    <line>I got <evidence>samples</evidence> from everybody--</line>

    <line>handymen... nothing.</line>
    <line>It was like chasing a ghost.</line>
    <line>Boss, I can't do this.</line>

    <line>Grow up.</line>
    <line>Open the door, <name>Larry</name>.</line>
    <line>Detective <name>Vera</name></line>
    <line>will take a little walk.</line>
    <line ending="question">This guy's sick, huh?</line>
    <line>Anything about it say</line>
    <line ending="question"><name>Bruce Elridge</name> to you?</line>
    <line>The <description>smugness</description> fits.</line>
    <line>He was such a <description>snob</description>.</line>
    <line>He'd never even say hello.</line>
    <line>So you didn't know him well.</line>
    <line>Nah.</line>
    <line>You told that you thought</line>
    <line><name>Gail</name> and her boyfriend were</line>
    <line>having a fight next door.</line>
    <line>If I may speak.</line>
    <line>I never saw anyone else</line>
    <line>go inside that apartment.</line>
    <line>What was your</line>
    <line ending="question">relationship with <name>Gail</name>?</line>
    <line>Good neighbors.</line>
    <line>Good friends.</line>
    <line>Maybe something could have blossomed</line>
    <line>if the world was laid out differently.</line>
    <line ending="question">So now you're flirting?</line>
    <line>You didn't say that five years ago.</line>
    <line>You asked about the call,</line>
    <line>not my relationship with <name>Gail</name>.</line>
    <line>Did the noise from next</line>
    <line ending="question">door wake you, <name>Larry</name>?</line>
    <line>I was up, working.</line>
    <line ending="question"><name>Gail</name>?</line>
    <line ending="question">What's going on in there?</line>
    <line>It sounds like</line>
    <line>more than reading.</line>
    <line>.</line>
    <line>I'm at Sansom.</line>
    <line>I'm worried about my neighbor.</line>
    <line>That was <description>heroic</description>,</line>
    <line>making that call, <name>Larry</name>.</line>
    <line>It was instinct.</line>
    <line>Anyway, uh...</line>
    <line>the cops came,</line>
    <line>knocked, left.</line>
    <line>She was found</line>
    <line>dead the next day.</line>
    <line>Cops can't break down a door just</line>
    <line>because some guy sense something.</line>
    <line>I gave a <evidence>DNA</evidence> sample right off.</line>
    <line>I'll give another one if you like.</line>
    <line>That's not necessary.</line>
    <line>So back to <name>Bruce</name>.</line>
    <line ending="question">You seen him lately?</line>
    <line>I did run into him a couple of months</line>
    <line>ago, up on the Penn campus.</line>
    <line>He does experiments</line>
    <line>at med school.</line>
    <line>Yeah, he was full of hot air</line>
    <line>about some kind of sleep</line>
    <line>study he's doing on cats.</line>
    <line start="hyphen">- Thank you.</line>
    <line start="hyphen">- Oh, yeah.</line>
    <line>Some maybe we</line>
    <line>should check that out.</line>
    <line>How'd you find out</line>
    <line ending="question">about his research?</line>
    <line>I track this guy.</line>
    <line>I knew it was animals, but</line>
    <line>I always figured it was lab rats.</line>
    <line>That's him.</line>
    <line>You can't talk to me.</line>
    <line>That letter you</line>
    <line>wrote gave me cause.</line>
    <line>Your pal here made my life</line>
    <line>miserable five years ago.</line>
    <line>You could have ended it at</line>
    <line>anytime by giving a <evidence>DNA</evidence> sample.</line>
    <line>Let's not have that</line>
    <line>conversation again.</line>
    <line><name>Bruce</name>,</line>
    <line>I'm the one who</line>
    <line>wanted to talk to you.</line>
    <line ending="question">And who are you?</line>
    <line>Detective <name>Rush</name>. I'm looking</line>
    <line>back into <name>Gail</name>'s <censored>m*rder</censored>.</line>
    <line>I was wondering about the</line>
    <line>animal research you do.</line>
    <line ending="question">What about it?</line>
    <line ending="question">We're talking cats, right?</line>
    <line>Yeah.</line>
    <line>And I don't feel guilty about it</line>
    <line>if that's your next question.</line>
    <line ending="question">You <censored><crime_term>k*ll</crime_term></censored> those cats? <slash>/</slash> If need be.</line>
    <line>If a person's got cancer</line>
    <line>I'm not gonna worry about testing</line>
    <line>on some useless animal.</line>
    <line ending="question">Why are they useless?</line>
    <line>They're <description>sub-human</description>.</line>
    <line start="hyphen">- <description>Small brains</description>.</line>
    <line start="hyphen">- Like women.</line>
    <line>Women have a use.</line>
    <line ending="question"><name>Bruce</name>, why not make this easy?</line>
    <line>Volunteer your <evidence>DNA</evidence>.</line>
    <line>Fourth amendment says</line>
    <line>I got a right to privacy.</line>
    <line>Don't you wanna be</line>
    <line ending="question">ruled out as a <crime_term>suspect</crime_term>?</line>
    <line>On the contrary.</line>
    <line>I don't want <description>desperate</description> detectives</line>
    <line>to act like it's a discovery</line>
    <line>if they match my <evidence>DNA</evidence> to semen</line>
    <line>that was on <name>Gail</name>'s sheets.</line>
    <line>I was her boyfriend.</line>
    <line>We were very active,</line>
    <line>if you get me.</line>
    <line>I'm sure my <evidence>DNA</evidence>'s</line>
    <line>all over that place.</line>
    <line>I see.</line>
    <line>I don't need a witch hunt</line>
    <line>just 'cause you couldn't</line>
    <line>solve this thing.</line>
    <line><name>Vera</name>.</line>
    <line ending="question">What is it about this job?</line>
    <line>You yap on all the time about the</line>
    <line ending="question">other cases. Why not this one?</line>
    <line>This one did things to me.</line>
    <line ending="question">Like what?</line>
    <line>You ever work a job</line>
    <line ending="question">makes you feel helpless?</line>
    <line>Yeah, I can always find</line>
    <line>motive, direction, but...</line>
    <line>that piece of crap, he stops.</line>
    <line>Leaves me with nothing.</line>
    <line>I start second guessing</line>
    <line ending="question">everything, you know?</line>
    <line>Maybe I'm not the</line>
    <line>bad ass I think I am.</line>
    <line start="hyphen">- I want this guy.</line>
    <line start="hyphen">- So do I.</line>
    <line>We can get him.</line>
    <line>But I need you, <name>Vera</name>.</line>
    <line>You know him</line>
    <line>better than anyone.</line>
    <line>If he's following his M.O.,</line>
    <line>he's already hunting...</line>
    <line>stalking someone right</line>
    <line>now following her home.</line>
    <line>Let's hope she's got</line>
    <line>her windows locked.</line>
    <line>I should have noticed</line>
    <line>that they all had cats.</line>
    <line>It didn't mean anything</line>
    <line>till we got the letter.</line>
    <line>It's a list of parolees who were locked up</line>
    <line>the last five years and just got out.</line>
    <line>One guy fits the time line,</line>
    <line>but he weights pounds.</line>
    <line ending="question">Since when?</line>
    <line>His whole life. It ain't him.</line>
    <line>Was worth a try. <slash>/</slash> Yeah.</line>
    <line ending="question">Well, how'd you do today?</line>
    <line>Found out <name>Bruce Elridge</name></line>
    <line>tortures cats for a living.</line>
    <line ending="question">Does he?</line>
    <line>Talks about <description>useless</description> animals</line>
    <line>and won't give up his <evidence>DNA</evidence>.</line>
    <line>I gotta go sit on him.</line>
    <line>Make sure he doesn't climb</line>
    <line>through anybody's window tonight.</line>
    <line>I got new addresses</line>
    <line>on the first <evidence>two victims</evidence>.</line>
    <line>They've both moved.</line>
    <line>Let's go.</line>
    <line>Wait till tomorrow.</line>
    <line>I don't want you going to these girls</line>
    <line>at midnight asking about their <censored><crime_term>r*pe</crime_term></censored>.</line>
    <line>Yeah.</line>
    <line>Tomorrow.</line>
    <line>Good night.</line>
    <line>My dad told me why you're here.</line>
    <line ending="question">Can I come in?</line>
    <line>No, I'd rather... I'd rather talk out here.</line>
    <line>We think he's back, <name>Ellen</name>.</line>
    <line>Oh, no.</line>
    <line ending="question">Can I show you a picture?</line>
    <line>A <crime_term>detective</crime_term> showed me</line>
    <line>that five years ago.</line>
    <line>I know.</line>
    <line>Just look again.</line>
    <line>Could this be the guy</line>
    <line ending="question">who <censored>att*cked</censored> you?</line>
    <line>I couldn't say.</line>
    <line>I never saw him.</line>
    <line>Did his voice sound like</line>
    <line ending="question">anyone you know?</line>
    <line>I told the first <crime_term>detective</crime_term> no.</line>
    <line>I don't think so.</line>
    <line>You said at the time you were</line>
    <line>certain it was a stranger.</line>
    <line>Right.</line>
    <line>You got a different feeling</line>
    <line ending="question">about that now?</line>
    <line>It's okay if you do.</line>
    <line>No.</line>
    <line>No, I don't know him.</line>
    <line>I really can't... I really</line>
    <line>can't tell you anything.</line>
    <line>The lead <crime_term>detective</crime_term> on</line>
    <line>this case is female, <name>Ellen</name>.</line>
    <line>Would you be more</line>
    <line ending="question">comfortable talking to her?</line>
    <line>Maybe.</line>
    <line>Okay.</line>
    <line>I gotta go to work, but, um...</line>
    <line>I'm home every day by : .</line>
    <line>All right.</line>
    <line>Could be him.</line>
    <line>Could be Yo Yo Ma.</line>
    <line>I didn't see crap.</line>
    <line>He covered your eyes right away.</line>
    <line>I'm in my kitchen...</line>
    <line>all of a sudden there's</line>
    <line>a towel over my face.</line>
    <line>Guy whispers that he's real</line>
    <line>sorry... <censored>r*pes</censored> me right there...</line>
    <line>and then stays for an hour,</line>
    <line>talking to me.</line>
    <line>I'm always nervous on first dates.</line>
    <line ending="question">But we did okay, didn't we?</line>
    <line>You were playing such</line>
    <line>a sad song before.</line>
    <line ending="question">You wanna play it for me?</line>
    <line>I don't think so.</line>
    <line>That's okay.</line>
    <line>Those bars on your windows</line>
    <line>are no good, honey.</line>
    <line>They're too far apart.</line>
    <line>You gotta be more careful.</line>
    <line>You know what he said to</line>
    <line ending="question">me right before he left?</line>
    <line>"Wish that we had met under</line>
    <line>different circumstances."</line>
    <line>I'm sorry, <name>Niki</name>.</line>
    <line>I just hope you finally get the guy.</line>
    <line>I don't wanna make you</line>
    <line>uncomportable, but, um...</line>
    <line>you were obviously in</line>
    <line>close contact with him.</line>
    <line>Yeah.</line>
    <line>He touched you. You</line>
    <line>must have touched him.</line>
    <line>Was there anything that you</line>
    <line ending="question">felt that was distinctive?</line>
    <line ending="question"><description>Scars? Moles?</description></line>
    <line>This is kind of weird...</line>
    <line>That's okay.</line>
    <line>I did touch him. I didn't</line>
    <line>do it to be intimate...</line>
    <line>Of course not.</line>
    <line>I was trying to get him off me.</line>
    <line>And you noticed something.</line>
    <line><description>Smooth skin</description>.</line>
    <line>Legs, arms, everything.</line>

    <line>Now we got his precious <evidence>DNA</evidence>.</line>
    <line>According to <name>Niki Lamas</name>,</line>
    <line>we're looking at a guy</line>
    <line>with <description>super smooth skin</description>.</line>
    <line>That's new.</line>
    <line>Maybe he shaves his</line>
    <line>body before he <censored>att*cks</censored>.</line>
    <line>No hair ever found at the scenes.</line>
    <line ending="question">Anything from <name>Ellen Curtis</name>?</line>

    <line>something. I'll go back to her today.</line>
    <line ending="question">And how's our boy <name>Vera</name> doing?</line>
    <line>He's... passionate.</line>
    <line>That passion almost compromised</line>
    <line>this case five years ago.</line>
    <line>I'm watching, boss.</line>
    <line>I hate to rat a guy out,</line>
    <line>but <name>Vera</name> just walked in with <name>Bruce Elridge</name>.</line>
    <line start="hyphen">- I can't have this...</line>
    <line start="hyphen">- Let me go.¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</line>

    <line>This isn't gonna help.</line>
    <line>You can't keep me here.</line>
    <line>I can keep you here for six hours.</line>
    <line ending="question">So what's with the animal experiments?</line>

    <line>I'm sorry I didn't do it earlier.</line>
    <line>You weren't ready earlier.</line>
    <line>I should have told that first <crime_term>detective</crime_term>.</line>
    <line>I was worried he'd think that</line>
    <line>since I'd talked to the guy...</line>
    <line>I'd let him on.</line>

    <line ending="question">Does it make sense now?</line>
    <line>Yeah, I guess.</line>
    <line>With the walks and all.</line>
    <line>Now that I think about it,</line>
    <line>he's only ridden that bike a couple</line>
    <line>times since I've known him.</line>
    <line ending="question"><name>Bridget</name>?</line>
    <line>I'm so sorry <name>Carl</name>.</line>
