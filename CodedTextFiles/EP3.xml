        And why is he sending us this letter?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        He's bragging. He's telling us he's back.

    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        He got through those bars?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Guy was some kind of spider.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        He could climb walls, get in tiny windows.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        - So he's skinny.
        - He's a contortionist.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Boss...
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I don't have the constitution to go after him again.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Why'd he <censored><crime_term>k*ll</crime_term></censored> <name>Gail</name> and not the others?
    </section>
    <section>

    </section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Just the <evidence>DNA</evidence> from his <evidence>sperm</evidence>, but we never found a match.
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I got <evidence>samples</evidence> from everybody-- the neighbors, plumbers,handymen... nothing.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        It was like chasing a ghost.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Boss, I can't do this.
    </section>
    <section>

    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        This case became a health issue for me.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Didn't you get any direction where to look?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        He only struck when the weather was warm, so I check out baseball teams, exchange students coming in for the Summer...
    </section>
    <section>

        - How come?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        He gave a shady, hostile interview.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Refused to give his <evidence>DNA</evidence>, had not one good <crime_term>alibi</crime_term> for any of the <censored>r*pes</censored>.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Unfortunately, <name>Vera's</name> under orders not to talk to him.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        - That's not official.
        - The D.A.'s office was very clear, <name>Nick</name>.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Do not approach him again.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        What did you do to him?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I was on the case.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        He was a serious <crime_term>suspect</crime_term>.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        He put him in the room four times.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        What am I supposed to do, start all over again?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        - I'll start it over.
        - Whoa, this is my job.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I'm not gonna get cut out of it.

        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I don't know.
    </section>

    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        We got the letter.
    </section>

    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>

        Yeah, I got an angle.

        - Forget it.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        You browbeat this guy, too?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        He's a <crime_term>material witness</crime_term>. I talk to him sometimes.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        <name>Larry</name>, it's <name>Lily Rush</name>. With <crime_term>Homicide</crime_term>.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I need to talk to you about <name>Gail</name>.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I'll talk to you. Not him.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Grow up.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Open the door, <name>Larry</name>.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Detective <name>Vera</name> will take a little walk.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        This guy's sick, huh?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Anything about it say <name>Bruce Elridge</name> to you?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        The smugness fits.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        He was such a snob. He'd never even say hello.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        So you didn't know him well.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Nah.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        You told that you thought <name>Gail</name> and her boyfriend were having a fight next door.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        If I may speak.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I never saw anyone else go inside that apartment.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        What was your relationship with <name>Gail</name>?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Good neighbors.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Good friends.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Maybe something could have blossomed if the world was laid out differently.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        So now you're flirting? You didn't say that five years ago.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        You asked about the call, not my relationship with <name>Gail</name>.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Did the noise from next door wake you, <name>Larry</name>?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I was up, working.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        <name>Gail</name>?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        What's going on in there?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        It sounds like more than reading.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        .
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I'm at Sansom.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I'm worried about my neighbor.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        That was heroic, making that call, <name>Larry</name>.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        It was instinct.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Anyway, uh...A the cops came,knocked, left.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        She was found dead the next day.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Cops can't break down a door just because some guy sense something.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I gave a <evidence>DNA</evidence> sample right off.
        I'll give another one if you like.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        That's not necessary.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        So back to <name>Bruce</name>.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        You seen him lately?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I did run into him a couple of months ago, up on the Penn campus.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        He does experiments at med school.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Yeah, he was full of hot air about some kind of sleep study he's doing on cats.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        - Thank you.
        - Oh, yeah.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Some maybe we should check that out.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        How'd you find out about his research?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I track this guy.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I knew it was animals, but I always figured it was lab rats.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        That's him.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        You can't talk to me.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        That letter you wrote gave me cause.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Your pal here made my life miserable five years ago.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        You could have ended it at anytime by giving a <evidence>DNA</evidence> sample.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Let's not have that conversation again.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        <name>Bruce</name>, I'm the one who wanted to talk to you.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        And who are you?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Detective <name>Rush</name>. I'm looking back into <name>Gail</name>'s <censored>m*rder</censored>.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I was wondering about the animal research you do.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        What about it?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        We're talking cats, right?
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        Yeah.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        And I don't feel guilty about it if that's your next question.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        You <censored><crime_term>k*ll</crime_term></censored> those cats? / If need be.
    </section>
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        If a person's got cancer I'm not gonna worry about testing on some useless animal.

        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        I got new addresses on the first <evidence>two victims</evidence>.
    </section>
    They've both moved.
    Let's go.
    Wait till tomorrow.
    I don't want you going to these girls at midnight asking about their <censored><crime_term>r*pe</crime_term></censored>.
    Yeah.
    Tomorrow.
    Good night.
    My dad told me why you're here.
    Can I come in?
    No, I'd rather... I'd rather talk out here.
    We think he's back, <name>Ellen</name>.
    Oh, no.
    Can I show you a picture?
    A <crime_term>detective</crime_term> showed me that five years ago.
    I know.
    Just look again.
    Could this be the guy who <censored>att*cked</censored> you?
    I couldn't say.
    I never saw him.
    Did his voice sound like anyone you know?
    I told the first <crime_term>detective</crime_term> no.
    I don't think so.
    You said at the time you were certain it was a stranger.
    Right.
    You got a different feeling about that now?
    It's okay if you do.
    No.
    No, I don't know him.
    I really can't... I really can't tell you anything.
    The lead <crime_term>detective</crime_term> on this case is female, <name>Ellen</name>.
    Would you be more comfortable talking to her?
    Maybe.
    Okay.
    I gotta go to work, but, um...
    I'm home every day by : .
    All right.
    Could be him.
    Could be Yo Yo Ma.
    I didn't see crap.
    He covered your eyes right away.
    I'm in my kitchen... all of a sudden there's a towel over my face.
    Guy whispers that he's real sorry... <censored>r*pes</censored> me right there... and then stays for an hour, talking to me.
    I'm always nervous on first dates.
    But we did okay, didn't we?
    You were playing such a sad song before.
    You wanna play it for me?
    I don't think so.
    That's okay.
    Those bars on your windows are no good, honey.
    They're too far apart.
    You gotta be more careful.
    You know what he said to me right before he left?
    "Wish that we had met under different circumstances."
    I'm sorry, <name>Niki</name>.
    I just hope you finally get the guy.
    I don't wanna make you uncomportable, but, um... you were obviously in close contact with him.
    Yeah.
    He touched you. You must have touched him.
    Was there anything that you felt that was distinctive?
    Scars? Moles?
    This is kind of weird...
    That's okay.
    I did touch him. I didn't do it to be intimate...
    Of course not.
    I was trying to get him off me.
    And you noticed something.
    Smooth skin.
    Legs, arms, everything.
    Soft and smooth like a woman's.
    Excuse me a second, <name>Niki</name>.
    What's that?
    <name>Bruce Elridge's</name> coffee cup.
    You stole his coffee?
    He abandoned it in a public place.
    Now we got his precious <evidence>DNA</evidence>.
    According to <name>Niki Lamas</name>, we're looking at a guy with super smooth skin.
    That's new.
    Maybe he shaves his body before he <censored>att*cks</censored>.
    No hair ever found at the scenes.
    Anything from <name>Ellen Curtis</name>?
    Jeffries got the sense she knew something. I'll go back to her today.
    And how's our boy <name>Vera</name> doing?
    He's... passionate.
    That passion almost compromised this case five years ago.
    I'm watching, boss.
    I hate to rat a guy out, but <name>Vera</name> just walked in with <name>Bruce Elridge</name>.
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        - I can't have this...
        - Let me go.¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
    </section>
    You'll want to look at this first.
    This isn't gonna help.
    You can't keep me here.
    I can keep you here for six hours.
    So what's with the animal experiments?
    What are you, an activist?
    Lot of <censored>K*llers</censored> start off torturing animals.
    But smart guy like you... know something about that.
    So what?
    Is that you, <name>Bruce</name>, hmm?
    Did you go from cats to women with your viciousness?
    That's a leap.
    You slip into their apartments with that wimp-boy frame of yours.
    You terrorize them and you pretend you're on a date?
    I've got a girlfriend.
    We're very, very happy.
    Maybe you didn't mean to <censored><crime_term>k*ll</crime_term></censored> <name>Gail</name>.
    Just <censored><crime_term>r*pe</crime_term></censored> her like the others.
    I didn't do anything to her, so why don't you stop acting like a thug.
    What'd you just call me, you little rube?
    Say it again, come on!
    Say it again.
    Say it again!
    <name>Vera</name>...
    Looks like <name>Bruce</name> here thinks I'm wasting his time.
    Come out here.
    <name>Bruce</name> has better things to do... / <name>Vera</name>!
    We got the <evidence>DNA</evidence> back.
    It's a negative match.
    You bunch of thugs!
    <name>Bruce</name>... what the <swear>hell's</swear> wrong with you?
    What's that supposed to mean?
    You knew we wouldn't match your <evidence>DNA</evidence>. / So?
    So why not give a sample five years ago like a normal person?
    I got a right to privacy.
    How's giving a swab of spit invading your privacy?
    A guy's got a right to have sex with his own girlfriend.
    Okay.
    Okay.
    You weren't having sex with her.
    Excuse me?
    You didn't want us to not find your <evidence>DNA</evidence>.
    It wasn't anywhere in that apartment, 'cause she was shutting you down.
    We went out for seven months.
    And by that time a guy's got a right.
    You think I wanted all those macho cops, all my friends, knowing I was putting up with such a prude?
    Hey, <name>Bruce</name>... this ain't high school.
    This case died five years ago and you could have helped us bring it in.
    And you coming off to your pals like some big stud isn't more important than a girl dying.
    My partner got the sense you knew we were on the wrong trail.
    How would I know that?
    Maybe you saw the guy.
    No.
    Maybe... you knew the guy?
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        - I really try not to think about this.
        - That's understandable.¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
    </section>
    But he contacted us.
    Let us know he's gonna do it again.
    I can't worry about that.
    If you could describe him...
    I can't. / I know that's what you've been saying all these years, but maybe it's because it's too painful.
    <name>Ellen</name>, I'm just scared it's gonna happen again.
    I never used to be scared of anything.
    No?
    Now I live with my parents.
    I'm terrified if I'm not home before dark.
    You had a life before.
    You just want it back.
    I don't think that's in the cards.
    I do.
    But you have to start by telling me what you saw that night.
    It might not be relevant.
    I was at the Free Library, outside buying a coffee and this, um... this guy started talking to me about books and I can't even remember what else.
    But it was only for, like, a few minutes... and then I went home.
    And that was it.
    Did you get his name?
    Then the <censored><crime_term>r*pe</crime_term></censored> happened that night...
    Olive?
    Edie?
    Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty.
    You scared me.
    I'm so sorry.
    First dates are hard.
    Especially with serious girls like you.
    I just wish we could met under different circumstances.
    It was so quick.
    It was like a flashbulb.
    And I, uh... I could be wrong, but... the face I keep seeing is the guy from the library.
    Um... dark hair... kind of shaggy.
    Smooth skin.
    This is gonna help us a lot.
    I'm sorry I didn't do it earlier.
    You weren't ready earlier.
    I should have told that first <crime_term>detective</crime_term>.
    I was worried he'd think that since I'd talked to the guy...
    I'd let him on.
    You know?
    Detective <name>Vera</name> only looks like a Neanderthal.
    Excuse me.
    What?
    Sex Crimes got an <censored>ass*ault</censored>, th and Lombard.
    Same M.O.?
    Crawled through the second floor window.
    Our boy is back.
    (*) up the drain pipe, climbed cross the walls, slipped in through the bars.
    Now, that's determination.
    Are there prints on the bars?
    Of course not.
    Ah, but he did leave a token behind.
    Kenfield, filter.
    Left it right at the bedside.
    This the victim?
    Yeah. Sex Crimes took her to the hopital.
    They know you want talk to her, though.
    We doing this together?
    Yeah.
    Please.
    Maybe I should have fought or something.
    There's no "should", <name>Tanya</name>.
    Does, uh... this look like him?
    He covered my eyes so quickly.
    Did he speak to you?
    Yeah.
    Afterwards, he talked a lot.
    He talked about art and books.
    I'm in grad school for art history, but I don't...
    I don't know how he knew that.
    Did you recognize his voice? / No.
    He was a stranger.
    You study art history?
    Yeah.
    Been to any museums lately?
    Um... I was at the <name>Rodin</name> a few days ago.
    Did you notice anything about this skin?
    It was... smooth.
    You know, like... hairless.
    No hair at all?
    Didn't seem like it.
    Do you know what he told me before he left?
    That he wished that we had met under...
    Under different circumstances.
    And that he was sorry.
    Does this guy stalk girls on Ben Franklin Parkway?
    <name>Gail</name> worked at the Museum of Art.
    <name>Ellen</name> was at the Free Library the day she was <censored>att*cked</censored>.
    And <name>Tanya</name> went to the <name>Rodin</name> last week.
    <name>Niki</name> was on Locust.
    Leaving the Academy of Music.
    Maybe he targets smart girls.
    All the victims were college types.
    "Serious girls." He said it to <name>Ellen</name>.
    Let's post this composite all over the Parkway.
    I got it.
    I interviewed a woman that worked with <name>Gail</name> at the art museum.
    <name>Anna</name>...
    <name>Anna... Berlin.</name>
    They had lunch together the day of the <censored>m*rder</censored>.
    We have this now.
    Let's see if she knows our new friends.
    Is this who <censored>k*lled</censored> <name>Gail</name>?
    Could be.
    Do you recognize him at all?
    I don't think so.
    Take your time.
    I can't be sure, but...
    But what?
    It sort of looks like a guy we'd see out here at lunchtime.
    You and <name>Gail</name> saw him?
    He'd hang out here, smoking, watching people.
    I kind of forgot about him.
    He hasn't been around for years, but he's been back lately.
    Ever get a name? / No.
    We only talked to him once.
    How's the pre-med student?
    Arrogant. Pushy.
    In other words, the same.
    I know, I have bad taste in men.
    You ladies work here?
    Yeah.
    How's the new exhibit?
    The Monet? It's beautiful.
    I recommend it.
    Maybe I'll take a look.
    See you in there.
    I didn't think to mention it to you back then.
    People are always asking questions.
    Do you think he may have been watching <name>Gail</name>?
    He wasn't there for the art.
    Got something.
    Girl was with a friend and her mom on Ben Franklin Parkway.
    Saw your composite.
    This is <name>Lily</name>. She's a police officer, too.
    Tell her what you told me.
    That's <name>Carl</name>.
    My mommy's boyfriend.
    What do you got?
    <name>Carl Heeley</name>, grew up in a trailer park in Trenton, moved up Philly at , worked as a security guard in the
    Franklin Institute from ' to ' .
    Across from the Free Library. / Yeah.
    And the last five years, he was at an army base in Portland.
    Just got back to town.
    How'd he behave in Oregon?
    Dishonorably discharged six weeks ago.
    Breaking into a female officer's room.
    Through the window.
    She was trained in combat though, unlike our girls.
    She fought him, ID'd him, and they sent him packing.
    Military will have boold types.
    We're getting a subpoena right now.
    Pick up this soldier.
    What's this about?
    A woman was <censored>r*ped</censored> inOld City last night.
    I'm sorry to hear that.
    Where were you last night, Carl?
    At home. Reading.
    Can anyone verify that?
    My girlfriend and her daughter.
    You a big reader, <name>Carl</name>?
    You could say.
    You lived in the area five years ago when three women <censored>r*ped</censored>.
    Do you remember anything about that?
    Not really.
    But you heard about it, right?
    Yeah, I think I remember something about it, but that was a long time ago.
    This looks a lot like you, don't you think?
    Sort of.
    Can you arrest a man for looking like a drawing?
    We're asking guys who look like this picture to take a <evidence>DNA</evidence> test.
    Would you do that?
    I'm sorry. I prefer not to.
    Look, I'd love to help you out, but
    I gotta get back new job and all.
    So, is there anything else?
    No.
    Crap.
    It was a Kenfield filter.
    <name>Carl</name> and I used to date, so...
    Well, you lived together, that's a bit different than dating, isn't it?
    <name>Cait</name>, honey, take <name>Dolly</name> and play in the room, okay?
    We lived together five years ago.
    We broke up when he moved.
    If you broke up, how'd you get this Army picture?
    We kept in touch.
    <name>Caitlin</name> says that <name>Carl's</name> still your boyfriend.
    That he's been around the apartment a lot.
    Yeah, well... maybe
    I never got over him.
    Do you remember those <censored>r*pes</censored> five years ago?
    Yeah.
    Do you remember that a girl was <censored>m*rder</censored>*d?
    What, you trying to say that was <name>Carl</name>?
    This is the guy.
    You tell me, <name>Bridget</name>.
    <name>Carl</name> is a good person.
    He is.
    He is. Just should see him with <name>Caitlin</name> and animals.
    Down at that shelter you work at?
    Yeah. He helps out sometimes.
    You got any pets here?
    No, no.
    <name>Carl</name> always says that dogs are for families and cats are for single girls.
    <section>
        <speaker>Unknown</speaker>
        - Mm. <name>Carl</name> says that, huh?
        - Yeah, we joke about it.
    </section>
    You know, cats and book clubs, two sure signs that a woman's all alone in the world.
    I'm guessing you wouldn't be caught dead at a book club.
    I noticed your Shakespeare collection over there.
    Yeah, <name>Carl</name> got that at a garage sale.
    You guys read the tragedies together?
    He looks at'em sometimes.
    I don't like books.
    Maybe that's why he took off five years ago.
    What do you mean?
    Nothing.
    No, what?
    We talked to <name>Carl</name> earlier today and he just wasn't, uh...
    very complimentary about your... brain power.
    That's mean.
    I thought so.
    Was he with you last night?
    Yeah, he was here.
    He go out after?
    He went out for a walk, late.
    'Cause there was another <censored><crime_term>r*pe</crime_term></censored> last night.
    Another woman who lives alone, with a cat.
    <name>Carl</name> take a lot of walks?
    Yeah. He has trouble sleeping.
    He always did.
    Honey... what's wrong?
    Nothing. Can't sleep is all.
    Come back to bed.
    I'm gonna get some air.
    Okay.
    Be careful.
    You, too.
    Keep the windows closed.
    Yeah, he did that a lot.
    He'd leave in the middle of the night.
    Didn't you think it was pretty odd that he shaved like that <name>Bridget</name>?
    He always shaved, you know? He said, um... it had to do, you know, with biking, for speed.
    Did he always shave at midnight?
    I don't know.
    You remember the <censored>r*pes</censored>, though, don't you?
    Yeah.
    Didn't you ever think...
    That I was living with a <censored>r*pist</censored>?
    No, I never thought that. Would you?
    Does it make sense now?
    Yeah, I guess.
    With the walks and all.
    Now that I think about it, he's only ridden that bike a couple times since I've known him.
    <name>Bridget</name>?
    I'm so sorry <name>Carl</name>.
    You really should be more careful.
    I just wish we should've met under different circumstances.
    Why are you here?
    We just wanna chat. Again.
    We called the base up in Oregon.
    Seems you got the same blood type as our <censored>r*pist</censored>.
    Type A is pretty common.
    We've got your letter, too.
    I'm not much of a writer.
    Plus that cigarette you left at <name>Tanya's</name>-- tells me you're just about ready to stop this.
    How'd them army boys deal with you shaving your chest and your legs?
    I cut that out up there.
    Didn't wanna be on the wrong side of "don't ask, don't tell," huh?
    I just didn't get much of a chance to bike in Oregon.
    What kind of people do you come from... <name>Carl</name>?
    Nothing special.
    Educated?
    No.
    Low rent?
    You could say.
    Not a lot of books in the trailer, I take it?
    My mom couldn't read.
    What about that sister of yours, the one that's in jail for prostitution? She a... big scholar?
    Yeah, you come from trash, you end up trash.
    With a trash girlfriend. You were looking for someone better.
    A classy girl with... education.
    I like girls with culture who don't eat their takeout right out of a box.
    Hm, like <name>Bridget</name>?
    <name>Bridget's</name> never been to a museum in her life.
    So you went looking for a girl with a little something upstairs.
    Trolling through the museums and libraries till you found her, then you followed her home.
    Looked to see if there was a cat in her window, 'cause that meant she was all alone in there.
    And you got that talent for getting into tiny places.
    Talk or don't talk.
    It doesn't matter anymore.
    <name>Bridget</name> gave us your razor.
    It's at the <evidence>DNA</evidence> lab right now. / Yep.
    We're just waiting for the official word.
    I used to slide down the laundry chute at my best friend's building.
    You can't believe how narrow it was.
    I'd get into the neighbor's house and steal things.
    It was like the one thing that
    I was really, really good at, getting into small places.
    I was, like, known for it.
    That's sensational, <name>Carl</name>.
    I told you... I was ready soon, soon as the weather changed.
    Yeah. You told us.
    I just had these demons.
    Is that why you joined the military?
    To maybe get some discipline?
    I kept them down for a while, but they came back.
    The... one in Oregon was a fighter, like the other ont that... / <name>Gail</name>.
    The girl you <censored>m*rder</censored>*d.
    I just wanted to... date her, you know, not hurt her.
    Quiet. I am sorry.
    Studying, huh?
