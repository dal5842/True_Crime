<xml><line>November ,</line>

<line>It's fun, right?</line>

<line>It's better than watching frat guys
playing beer pong.</line>

<line>You get credit for working
on the campaign?</line>

<line>Oh yeah, but I'd do it anyway.</line>

<line>Does it bother you that
he's such a womanizer?</line>

<line>He's not gonna do
that in the White House.</line>

<line>Who's the face?</line>

<line>He's David Lake.
He runs our campaign office.</line>

<line>That his girlfriend?</line>

<line>Sister.</line>

<line>Vanessa, that drunk they threw out,</line>

<line>is he with you?</line>

<line>I'm not with him any..
- Cuz that was embarrassing.</line>

<line>I know, I'm sorry.</line>

<line>It wasn't her fault, Abbey.</line>

<line>David, we never got to talk.</line>

<line>Uh, later. I promise.</line>

<line>Well, him, I'd vote for.</line>

<line>They're saying
he's the future of the party.</line>

<line>It's loud in here.
You wanna walk outside?</line>

<line>Hey.</line>

<line>What took you so long?</line>

<line>Had to doll up.</line>

<line>Vera got lucky.</line>

<line>I'm on the up desk all night,</line>

<line>eight minutes to go on the shift
and this guy's gotta buy it.</line>

<line>Darren Clemen, two in the head.</line>

<line>Up close.
- Any witnesses?</line>

<line>They heard it,
but they didn't see it.</line>

<line>Working cold jobs, you almost
forget how much blood there is.</line>

<line>It does seem extra gory.</line>

<line>I'm assuming there's a good reason
we got dragged down here?</line>

<line>Inside.</line>

<line>The guy didn't believe in house work.</line>

<line>Looks like some kind of shrine.</line>

<line>Or a trophy case.</line>

<line>About the death of Vanessa Prosser.</line>

<line>Who's that?</line>

<line>m*rder victim, .</line>

<line>Never found her k*ller.</line>

<line>Never say never.</line>

<line>Vanessa Prosser was
a college senior working</line>

<line>on the local Clinton campaign.</line>

<line>Went to election party
on November, rd, .</line>

<line>Washed up on the bank of
the Delaware the next morning
with a broken neck.</line>

<line>Republicans thought
they had a bad night</line>

<line>Best guess is she was tossed
from the Ben Franklin bridge.</line>

<line>It could've been a fall.</line>

<line>Bruising under her arms.</line>

<line>Dragged and dumped.</line>

<line>A letter was found in her pocket.</line>

<line>Signature and most of
the prints were washed away,</line>

<line>but few words are readable.</line>

<line>Been afraid..</line>

<line>Wanting to..</line>

<line>Feelings for you...</line>

<line>An admirer.</line>

<line>With good penmanship.</line>

<line>Lead suspect was Aaron Dutra,
Vanessa's ex,</line>

<line>an ROTC Penn-grad just
gotten back from the Gulf w*r.</line>

<line>He got thrown
out of the party that night.</line>

<line>Case against him didn't stick, though.</line>

<line>Hmm, among other things,</line>

<line>bad penmanship.</line>

<line>We think the letter came from
Clemen, this new victim.</line>

<line>He had a kind of
an obssession with her.</line>

<line>What else do we know
about this guy?</line>

<line>No record, no warrants.
Name's clean.</line>

<line>Can't say the same for his house.</line>

<line>Neighbor said the wife died
three years ago.</line>

<line>He turned into a hermit,
let the place go.</line>

<line>And the relationship between him
and the Prosser girl?</line>

<line>No connections, yet, but he did
have some of her personal items.</line>

<line>Receipts, school papers,
journal entries.</line>

<line>Maybe he was stalking her.</line>

<line>But how'd he get her stuff?</line>

<line>Walter Spar was assigned to this
case. Will, do you know where he is?</line>

<line>Maybe the shore, I'll find him.</line>

<line>Let's see if Vanessa's parents
know who Clemen was to her.</line>

<line>No.
I don't know him.</line>

<line>Who is he?</line>

<line>His name is Darren Clemen.
He was k*lled last night.</line>

<line>k*lled?</line>

<line>What's this got to do with Vanessa?</line>

<line>We were hoping you could tell us.</line>

<line>She was living at home, right?</line>

<line>Yes, she was trying to save money.</line>

<line>She wanted to spend
the summer in Washington.</line>

<line>This man had some of
Vanessa's things at his house.</line>

<line>Well, I don't understand
how that could be.</line>

<line>One theory is Vanessa was
involved with this guy.</line>

<line>But, he looks like he's twice her age.</line>

<line>Though that might explain something.</line>

<line>Few weeks before Vanessa died,</line>

<line>we were making dinner.</line>

<line>George Bush is a w*r hero.</line>

<line>He doesn't know
what a grocery scanner is.</line>

<line>Well, I, for one,
like that Hillary Clinton.</line>

<line>I liked her headbands, and I don't
know why she had to change it.</line>

<line>Dad, you have to vote for Clinton.
I need a job next year.</line>

<line>And never mind
the Jennifer Flowers tapes.</line>

<line>Jennifer Flowers is a skank.</line>

<line>That's one thing we can agree on.</line>

<line>Ahem. For Vanessa.</line>

<line>Aaron? Still thinks
he's in the game, huh?</line>

<line>No, not from Aaron.
- Oh? Who from?</line>

<line>It's just a thank-you
from the campaign.</line>

<line>Oh, oh, apply pressure. Here.</line>

<line>Direct pressure, come on. Hold it.
Grab it, honey.</line>

<line>Hurry up, hurry up. Here we go.
Keep pressing.</line>

<line>And then we got distracted
when she cut herself.</line>

<line>Her blood didn't clot properly.</line>

<line>So you never found out
who sent the flowers?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>This says you didn't realize that
Vanessa was missing till the next day.</line>

<line>We figured she'd gone back to her
friend's place on campus, Beth Reardon.</line>

<line>She drove that night.</line>

<line>You build all these?</line>

<line>I just design them.</line>

<line>I'm an architect, not the contractor.</line>

<line>I've never seen him before.</line>

<line>Who is he?</line>

<line>Maybe someone Vanessa
was involved with.</line>

<line>I doubt that.</line>

<line>You have better candidate?</line>

<line>I thought she had something going on,</line>

<line>but she was being secretive.</line>

<line>Anyone else who might know
who Vanessa was seeing?</line>

<line>Ask Aaron Dutra.</line>

<line>He was all but stalking
her at the time.</line>

<line>Her old boyfriend?</line>

<line>She broke up with him, but he
wasn't taking no for an answer.</line>

<line>You see him at the party that night?</line>

<line>He was hard to miss.</line>

<line>I couldn't vote for Clinton,
I was too jealous of the Gore girls.</line>

<line>Gore is crazy.
He kept dropping out of the race.</line>

<line>I liked Stockdale in the debate.
- Vanessa.</line>

<line>Why are you here?</line>

<line>You were supposed to wait, V.</line>

<line>You're drunk.</line>

<line>Shut up.</line>

<line>Aaron, it's over.
I told you this.</line>

<line>I saw you with him today.</line>

<line>You're following me?</line>

<line>I saw him touch you, like you're his..</line>

<line>Stop.</line>

<line>Where is he? / Aaron.</line>

<line>Where is he?
I know he's here.</line>

<line>Aaron. Sleep it off.</line>

<line>Cops had asked me
about him the first time around.</line>

<line>He was an idiot, but</line>

<line>not a k*ller.</line>

<line>You and Aaron ever compare notes</line>

<line>on who this other guy
might have been?</line>

<line>Aaron and I never compared anything.</line>

<line>He got sick after that.</line>

<line>Sick?</line>

<line>I heard it was Gulf w*r Syndrome.</line>

<line>Sounds like Vanessa's ex saw her</line>

<line>with the new admirer
the day she died.</line>

<line>You've gone to him?</line>

<line>He was too sick to see us today.
We'll go back tomorrow.</line>

<line>That was Walter's partner.</line>

<line>He remembers the Prosser case?</line>

<line>Remembers Darren Clemen, too.</line>

<line>Said he started coming around
few years back,</line>

<line>had a bunch of theories
on how the girl died.</line>

<line>What, he came with here with theories?</line>

<line>Thought it was some kind of
political conspiracy.</line>

<line>So, he was trying to solve her m*rder.</line>

<line>Why was he interested in Vanessa?</line>

<line>We still don't have a connection.</line>

<line>Maybe we do.</line>

<line>Remember all the blood
at the Clemen scene?</line>

<line>The autopsy explained it,
he was a hemophilliac.</line>

<line>Like Vanessa.</line>

<line>Wait, it's hereditary?</line>

<line>Coroner says yes.
Females are just carriers,</line>

<line>but some show symptoms.</line>

<line>Blood relation.</line>

<line>Vanessa was
Darren Clemen's daughter?</line>

<line>Yes, he was Vanessa's father.</line>

<line>It wasn't even an affair.
It was just one night.</line>

<line>You were already married?</line>

<line>Darren was
my high school sweetheart.</line>

<line>We had our ten year reunion.
His pals had a suite upstairs.</line>

<line>Old time's sake?</line>

<line>Stupid,</line>

<line>very stupid.</line>

<line>My husband doesn't know
and neither did Vanessa.</line>

<line>Did Darren keep in touch?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>No, we agreed on that.</line>

<line>We had separate lives
till three years ago.</line>

<line>When he started looking into
Vanessa's death?</line>

<line>His wife had died.
Said he was trying to fill the void.</line>

<line>Any idea who he suspected?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>I let him look through Vanessa's things</line>

<line>and then I asked him not to come back.</line>

<line>I had just lost my daughter.</line>

<line>I couldn't risk losing
my husband, too.</line>

<line>If Clemen was looking into Vanessa's
m*rder and got too close to the truth,</line>

<line>that could explain his death, too.</line>

<line>So we're thinking one doer
for both murders.</line>

<line>We gotta find out what Clemen knew.</line>

<line>Who he was after.</line>

<line>Where you been, Scotty?</line>

<line>Charming the pants off for
a -year-old historian
who works for the DNC.</line>

<line>You get the photo?</line>

<line>Everyone on the regional
campaign in ' ,</line>

<line>taken at the day of the election.</line>

<line>Vanessa's ex came to the party
looking for her new guy.</line>

<line>Maybe the new guy's here.</line>

<line>Who's Kite with?</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>I heard you and him were..
- Yeah, I don't know.</line>

<line>Let's go see
if Aaron's feeling better.</line>

<line>Whatever it is,
I was here watching  TV.</line>

<line>It's about Vanessa Prosser.</line>

<line>Of course, it is.</line>

<line>The night of her m*rder, you showed
up at the election party pretty upset.</line>

<line>Look at your records.</line>

<line>I've had this conversation
a hundred times already.</line>

<line>Let's make it hundred and one.</line>

<line>It was the turkey talking, burbon.</line>

<line>I've been drinking all day.</line>

<line>Can you turn off the cooking show?</line>

<line>Before I went to the Gulf,
Vanessa and I got engaged.</line>

<line>When I got back, she was
supposed to be waiting for me.</line>

<line>And instead she found
someone new?</line>

<line>Could you ID her
new boyfriend from a picture?</line>

<line>Him.
Glasses, front.</line>

<line>You're sure?</line>

%.

<line>Thanks.</line>

<line>Hi.</line>

<line>Thank you very much.</line>

<line>I voted, did you? / Yeah.</line>

<line>You know, I consider myself
a reasonably smart guy,</line>

- but those ballots are confusing.
<line>I know.</line>

<line>What happens if you don't
knock out little square all the way?</line>

<line>Who knows?</line>

<line>David Lake.</line>

<line>I know that name.</line>

<line>Abbey Lake.</line>

<line>Congressman's chief of staff.</line>

<line>Detectives Rush and Valens.</line>

<line>Sister, not wife.
Everyone makes that mistake.</line>

<line>We're here to talk to David.</line>

<line>Oh, sorry, he's in Washington.</line>

<line>Maybe I can help?</line>

<line>We're looking into an old homicide.</line>

<line>Vanessa Prosser?</line>

<line>That was awful.</line>

<line>She was a really nice girl.</line>

<line>We heard she and your brother
might have been involved.</line>

<line>Her and David?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>You sure?</line>

<line>A lot of girls in the campaign
were charmed by David.</line>

<line>It's the story of his life.</line>

<line>Occupational hazard.</line>

<line>Vanessa was a lot
like the other girls.</line>

<line>That's all.</line>

<line>Ready?</line>

<line>Are we in a hurry?</line>

<line>We have a conference call
in an hour.</line>

<line>That's right.</line>

<line>We'll see you at the party?</line>

<line>David, I have something I want to ...
- The polls close in four hours.</line>

<line>We need you on the phones.</line>

<line>Final push.</line>

<line>You'll see him tonight, Vanessa.</line>

<line>She was sweet,</line>

<line>but young, naive.</line>

<line>Starstruck?</line>

<line>David's only human.
He gets flattered.</line>

<line>Part of my job was
and is keeping him focused.</line>

<line>Still, we'd like to talk to your brother.</line>

<line>Soon as he's back in town.</line>

<line>I'm here at the local
Democratic election party</line>

where hundreds of volunteers
<line>have helped Bill Clinton...</line>

: , <line>election night.</line>

<line>Abbey Lake, David's sister.</line>

<line>And the future congressman himself.</line>

<line>No Vanessa, though.</line>

<line>Could be out of frame.</line>

<line>Could be dead.</line>

<line>We think Lake had a relationship
with Vanessa?</line>

<line>His sister says no.</line>

<line>Well, we'll see if his handwriting
matches that letter found on her body.</line>

<line>Be delicate, Scotty.</line>

<line>He runs to his friends
in the mayor's office,</line>

<line>I'm the one who gets the call.</line>

<line>What else do we know about him?</line>

<line>Been in Washington since ,
elected to Congress two years ago.</line>

<line>Went to Princeton,
Columbia Law.</line>

<line>Raised up north in Redding.</line>

<line>Redding?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>My victim made a couple calls to
Redding the day he got shot.</line>

<line>Clemen did?</line>

<line>Yeah. To a guy named Marvin Dobie.</line>

<line>Marvin Dobie?</line>

<line>Philadelphia Homicide.</line>

<line>Yeah, so?</line>

<line>Hey, nice. Custom job.</line>

<line>Bamboo rod, tail water reel.</line>

<line>Expensive hobby.</line>

<line>Convictions for fraud,
forgery, bad checks.</line>

<line>Which of those hobbies
got you that rod?</line>

<line>What do you want from me?</line>

<line>You know a guy named
Darren Clemen?</line>

<line>Nah.</line>

<line>Really?</line>

<line>He called you last week.</line>

<line>Well, maybe
he got a wrong number.</line>

<line>Talk to wrong numbers
for six minutes?</line>

<line>Maybe I got lonely.</line>

<line>Clemen got k*lled later that day.</line>

<line>You know anything about that?</line>

<line>Dead, whoa.</line>

<line>Know him now?</line>

<line>How about her?
Name's Vanessa Prosser.</line>

<line>Sorry, anyone else?</line>

<line>How about Congressman
David Lake?</line>

<line>Yeah, I'll have him,
he's from the neighborhood.</line>

<line>You friendly?</line>

<line>I wouldn't say that.</line>

<line>Look, I gotta get to the scrap yard.</line>

<line>This your writing?</line>

<line>No, man.
That's the architect.</line>

<line>They all write like that.</line>

<line>Old set of blueprints from Dobie.
Check on the print.</line>

<line>Here's the letter from Vanessa's
pocket. Compare this two.</line>

<line>Dobie's architect wrote
Vanessa a love letter?</line>

<line>They almost match.
- Almost.</line>

<line>This is called lettering.</line>

<line>You look at any set of plans,
it basically looks like this.</line>

<line>All architects print this way for clarity.</line>

<line>So, it's hard to tell one from the next.</line>

<line>And we only got one architect
in this investigation.</line>

<line>Beth Reardon.</line>

<line>Where did you find this?</line>

<line>It was in Vanessa's pocket.</line>

<line>It's your writing, isn't it?</line>

<line>I guess I was kind of in love with her.</line>

<line>It's my fault she died.</line>

<line>Why do you say that?</line>

<line>We went outside.</line>

<line>I knew something was bothering her.</line>

<line>Don't worry about Aaron.</line>

<line>He'll regret it all in the morning.</line>

<line>I'm not.</line>

<line>Then what are you worried about?</line>

<line>You're not telling me something.</line>

<line>You ever wish you could just go backwards</line>

<line>and unlearn something?</line>

<line>Like?</line>

<line>I just want things to be simple.</line>

<line>But they're a mess.</line>

<line>Tell me what you mean.</line>

<line>I can't.</line>

<line>Beth. / I'm sorry.</line>

<line>I don't know what to say.</line>

<line>Don't say anything.</line>

<line>Just read.</line>

<line>I was awry that night.</line>

<line>If I hadn't left, maybe
she'd still be alive.</line>

<line>You told the first detectives you were
at home the rest of the night.</line>

<line>Passed out on my bathroom floor.</line>

<line>So no alibi, then?</line>

<line>That's my alibi.</line>

<line>That's where I was.</line>

<line>How about this past Thursday night?</line>

<line>I was in the ER.
My son had an asthma attack.</line>

<line>Did Vanessa ever mention
the name Marvin Dobie?</line>

<line>Ex-con from Redding.</line>

<line>No bells?</line>

<line>Redding.</line>

<line>Um, she took a bus to Redding,
a few days before the election.</line>

<line>She say why?</line>

<line>I heard her on the phone
checking schedules.</line>

<line>When I asked her about about it,</line>

<line>she changed the subject.</line>

<line>Darren Clemen calls Dobie
in Redding, ends up dead.</line>

<line>Vanessa goes to Redding..</line>

<line>Probably to contact Dobie.</line>

<line>Same ending.</line>

<line>All roads lead to Redding.</line>

<line>Congressman's hometown.</line>

<line>Believe me, I understand
the need for low income housing.</line>

<line>I come from humble beginnings,
and if it were up to me,</line>

<line>we'd break ground tomorrow.</line>

<line>But we just simply
don't have the resources.</line>

<line>Me siento mucho.</line>

<line>He just told them he sets down a lot.</line>

<line>Gracias, gracias.
Thank you for coming.</line>

<line>How are you?</line>

<line>Vanessa and I worked
on the campaign together.</line>

<line>That all you did together?</line>

<line>We hear you may have been
more than co-workers.</line>

<line>Excuse me, just had lasik.</line>

<line>Put it off as long as I could.</line>

<line>in both eyes.</line>

<line>Contacts never seem to fit right.</line>

<line>This a fillibuster, Congressman?</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>Vanessa and I were involved.</line>

<line>But you kept it quiet.</line>

<line>Well, I didn't want more than
one people in the campaign to know.</line>

<line>And after Vanessa died?</line>

<line>My coming forward
wouldn't have helped.</line>

<line>Wouldn't helped you.</line>

<line>I had no information.</line>

<line>And I was concerned about being
associated with an event like that.</line>

<line>Even though it was
your girlfriend that got k*lled?</line>

<line>She wasn't though.</line>

<line>We broke things off that night.</line>

<line>You been avoiding me?</line>

<line>No, I think you have that reversed.</line>

<line>Where's your friend?</line>

<line>She went home.</line>

<line>And the ex-boyfriend?</line>

<line>Don't know.</line>

<line>Don't care.</line>

<line>V, I've been offered a position</line>

<line>in Washington.</line>

<line>That's great. / Yeah.</line>

<line>That's what you wanted.</line>

<line>Thing is,</line>

<line>it wouldn't make sense for us
to make this long distance.</line>

<line>I thought the idea was that we were</line>

<line>gonna go to Washington together,
not break up.</line>

<line>Things have a way of turning
on a dime in this business.</line>

<line>Is it because of Abbey?</line>

<line>What did Abbey have to do with it?</line>

<line>She was always worried about
loose ends with the girls I dated.</line>

<line>You ever get back to your humble
beginnings in Redding?</line>

<line>Not really, no time.</line>

<line>Cuz Vanessa did.</line>

<line>Yeah, went to see a guy
named Marvin Dobie.</line>

<line>I don't know the name.</line>

<line>Says he lived in your neighborhood.</line>

<line>I pride myself on my ability to
remember people.</line>

<line>Thanks for being frank with us.</line>

<line>If there's one thing I learned
from Bill Clinton,</line>

<line>never lie about that sort of thing.</line>

<line>Maybe he didn't lie about Vanessa.</line>

<line>He lied about Dobie.</line>

<line>You found a connection?</line>

<line>Yeah, pulled the forms to see
who posted bail</line>

<line>on Dobie's arrest. Fraud, ' .</line>

dollar bond posted
<line>by Linda Savis.</line>

<line>Who's that?</line>

<line>Got her own record for prostitution,
but only once under that name.</line>

<line>In her married year,
she was known as..</line>

<line>Linda Lake.</line>

<line>Mother of David and Abbey.</line>

<line>What did she had to do with Dobie?</line>

<line>Shared an address for an year.</line>

<line>Probably a boyfriend.</line>

<line>So Dobie didn't live in the same
neighborhood with David Lake.</line>

<line>He lived in the same house.</line>

<line>And Lake can't place the name.</line>

<line>Which is doubly curious considering
the checks he's been writing.</line>

<line>Marvin Dobie</line>

<line>has been getting payments
from a trust since the late eighties,</line>

<line>a trust set up by David Lake.</line>

<line>Had the congressman giving
Dobie a financial support?</line>

<line>But what is Dobie giving him?</line>

<line>You said you didn't know
Darren Clemen.</line>

<line>Or Vanessa Prosser.</line>

<line>We think you did though and
now they're both dead.</line>

<line>Not cuz of me.</line>

<line>Cuz of something you know then?</line>

<line>You also lied
about Congressman Lake.</line>

<line>Not only did you know him,</line>

<line>you lived in his house
when he was a teenager.</line>

<line>I ain't talking about Lake.</line>

<line>Don't want them checks
to stop coming.</line>

<line>Someone's going away
for this girl's m*rder.</line>

<line>Comes down to you or Lake,</line>

<line>who do you think gets
the benefit of the doubt?</line>

<line>The congressman or
the ex-con?</line>

<line>Lake has resources,
lawyers, status.</line>

<line>What have you got?</line>

<line>Self respect.</line>

<line>That's more than he can say.</line>

<line>You tell me I don't get rung up
on some extortion rap.</line>

<line>And I tell you what you wanna know.</line>

<line>I think we can sell that to the D.A.</line>



<line>Clemen called me up.</line>

<line>Said he found my name
in this girl's stuff.</line>

<line>How that happened, I don't know.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>Asked what I knew
about her getting k*lled.</line>

<line>What'd you tell him?</line>

<line>Nothing to tell.</line>

<line>I didn't know she was dead.</line>

<line>I met her that one time.
That's all I knew of her.</line>

<line>So Vanessa did visit you in ' .</line>

<line>I don't know how she found me.</line>

<line>She just showed up at my door,
out of the blue.</line>

<line>Why does David Lake
send you money?</line>

<line>David who, darling?</line>

<line>Look, I'm not looking for trouble.
I just..</line>

<line>I just wanna know why.</line>

<line>I don't know
what you're talking about.</line>

<line>He writes you checks.
I've seen them.</line>

<line>Are you some kind of a reporter?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>I'm a friend.</line>

<line>You go home, little girl.</line>

<line>Buy yourself some shoes,
take your mind off of things.</line>

<line>I don't know what you're doing,</line>

<line>but I know enough to call the police.</line>

<line>Why don't you just ask David?</line>

<line>I did.</line>

<line>He won't tell me anything.</line>

<line>You aren't just a friend of his,
aren't you?</line>

<line>God, I almost feel bad for you.</line>

<line>Why did you feel bad for her?</line>

<line>She was in over her head.</line>

<line>See,</line>

<line>David and his sister Abbey,</line>

<line>they were more than friends, too.</line>

<line>Brother and sister.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Dobie caught them a few times
while he was living with them.</line>

<line>He have proof?</line>

<line>What, like pictures?</line>

<line>Yeah. / No, no pictures.</line>

<line>But David and Abbey were worried
enough to be paying him off
for past years.</line>

<line>Man, I voted for this guy.</line>

<line>Dobie told Vanessa Prosser about it.</line>

<line>We think she went and
confronted the happy couple.</line>

<line>And got k*lled for it.</line>

<line>And last week, Dobie called
the congressman</line>

<line>to report that Darren Clemen
was sniffing around.</line>

<line>Few hours later, Clemen ends up
with two in the head.</line>

<line>But Lake was in D.C. that day.</line>

<line>Dobie says Abbey took the call.</line>

<line>So you think Abbey did both jobs.</line>

<line>When it comes to her brother,</line>

<line>Abbey takes care of everything.</line>

<line>Dobie's got a sheet like a w*r
and peace, Kite.</line>

<line>Maybe he can be compelled to testify.</line>

<line>Hearsay from a repeat felon
won't buy you much.</line>

<line>You wanna get our m*rder?</line>

<line>You gotta get her to talk.</line>

<line>I didn't k*ll anyone.</line>

<line>What would give you
an idea like that?</line>

<line>Not what,</line>

<line>who.</line>

<line>Acquaintance of yours.
Kind of an in-law actually.</line>

<line>Marvin Dobie.</line>

<line>What rock did he crawl out
from under?</line>

<line>You should know.</line>

<line>You paid for it.</line>

<line>Hush money couldn't keep
him quiet though.</line>

<line>Your own brother, Abbey?</line>

<line>My own brother what?</line>

<line>When it gets out David Lake took
advantage of his sister</line>

<line>when they were teenagers.</line>

<line>That'll finish him.</line>

<line>Do you have any idea
how that sounds?</line>

<line>I know how it's gonna read.</line>

<line>National Enquirer, Star.
- The jit papers, too.</line>

<line>Now, they'll stop
the presses for this one.</line>

<line>That would be slander,
we'd sue you.</line>

<line>By that time, everyone will know.</line>

<line>Canon, ring a bell?</line>

<line>That charming brother of
yours won't have a career left.</line>

<line>Maybe that's what Abbey wants.</line>

<line>To have her favorite guy all to herself.</line>

<line>That's why you k*lled Vanessa,
isn't it?</line>

<line>What do you say, Abbey?</line>

<line>We call up the gossip rags or
you start spilling.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>I need assurances.</line>

<line>What kind?</line>

<line>You keep certain things
out of the press.</line>

<line>They'll come out at trial.</line>

<line>Not if I plead guilty.</line>

<line>David didn't take advantage of me,
I was older.</line>

<line>It was me.</line>

<line>And Vanessa found this out?</line>

<line>She should've minded her
own business.</line>

<line>Adams Morgan.</line>

<line>How about Georgetown?</line>

<line>It'd be so great if we could work
at the White House.</line>

<line>Assuming Clinton wins.</line>

<line>We could get an apartment together.</line>

<line>Dog?</line>

<line>Cat.</line>

<line>Both.</line>

<line>I wanna go to every museum
on the mall.</line>

<line>It's easy train trip back to Philly.</line>

<line>It would be great, V.</line>

<line>Abbey. / Hi.</line>

<line>Sorry, it's late, I know.</line>

<line>How long have
you been standing there?</line>

<line>What do you mean?</line>

<line>I just got here.</line>

<line>I need you to sign some checks.</line>

, <line>now?</line>

<line>That's his new number.</line>

<line>Forget it, we can't let him
keep raising the amount.</line>

<line>You want a future in the public eye,</line>

<line>you pay him.</line>

<line>Then we get a girl curious.</line>

<line>If I'd been more successful
at deflecting her,</line>

<line>I wouldn't have had to do
what I did.</line>

<line>Which was?</line>

<line>I sent her down the stairs
to the hotel parking garage,</line>

<line>then dumped her from the bridge.</line>

<line>All for David's brilliant career?</line>

<line>I owed him</line>

<line>for what I did
when we were young.</line>

<line>And David agreed to sweep
the sound of the rug?</line>

<line>He doesn't know anything.</line>

<line>What about Clemen?</line>

<line>Doesn't know about him either.</line>

<line>You admit to sh**ting him?</line>

<line>Two sh*ts.</line>

<line>He was as close as
you are right now.</line>

<line>That was your . ?</line>

<line>IT was a . .</line>

<line>You can find it in my apartment.</line>

<line>Hey, we got a g*n.</line>

<line>Ballistics will test fire and compare
but she looks good for it.</line>

<line>Well, that'll make the bosses happy.
Better her than the congressman.</line>

<line>You were getting
nervous upstairs, huh?</line>

<line>Can I show you something?</line>

<line>He ain't wearing his glasses.</line>

<line>So? / So,</line>

<line>where'd they go?</line>

<line>I lose mine three times a day,
Scotty.</line>

<line>You're not blind without them.
Lake said he had vision.</line>

<line>What's your theory?</line>

<line>Maybe lost them in a struggle.</line>

<line>Abbey's taking the fall.</line>

<line>In her twisted devotion to David,
she figures better to let him go on</line>

<line>doing all his good,
she'll sit in jail.</line>

<line>That's a little thin.
- It makes sense.</line>

<line>Scotty, we got nothing on him.</line>

<line>I know he did it.
- But we can't make the case.</line>

<line>Sooner or later, Scotty,
one's gonna get by you.</line>

<line>Happens to us all.</line>

<line>I wanna go see Lake
one more time.</line>

<line>I don't know who Darren Clemen is.</line>

<line>He's Vanessa's real father.</line>

<line>He was looking into her death.</line>

<line>Which means he was looking into you.</line>

<line>You think I k*lled Vanessa?</line>

<line>Leaning there.</line>

<line>Except, your sister says she did it.</line>

<line>She said that?</line>

<line>Made a deal.</line>

<line>Copped to both murders
in exchange,</line>

<line>we don't leak your dirty little secret.</line>

<line>I have to call Abbey.</line>

<line>Without your help,
she's looking at life.</line>

<line>How can I help?</line>

<line>Tell us what happened to Vanessa.</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>You know.</line>

<line>Excuse me.</line>

<line>I don't have anything more to say.</line>

<line>He almost sweat in there.</line>

<line>You know that call Stillman
didn't want to get from the brass?</line>

<line>He got it.</line>

<line>We have to leave Lake alone.</line>

<line>Commissioner's orders.</line>

<line>Hey.</line>

<line>Heard you went back
at the congressman.</line>

<line>Yeah. Till the bosses shut us down.</line>

<line>Got a pretty good case against the sister.</line>

<line>Yeah, it must be nice having
a different set of rules.</line>

<line>Saw you with that new A.D.A.</line>

<line>Julie? / Yeah.</line>

<line>Julie.</line>

<line>Actually, I'm on my way to meet her now.</line>

<line>Have fun.</line>

<line>Rush,</line>

<line>Rush.</line>

<line>I'll cut her loose right now
if it's just you and me,</line>

<line>but I haven't heard that from you.</line>

<line>So until you've decided that...
- Okay, okay.</line>

<line>Okay what?</line>

<line>Just you and me.</line>

<line>Then, I'll go meet her right now.</line>

<line>Be polite for now and tell her
that I'm otherwise engaged.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>Congressman.</line>

<line>You're not allowed to be here.</line>

<line>Off duty.</line>

<line>Just two guys talking.</line>

<line>I don't think so.</line>

<line>Your life's pretty important, huh?</line>

<line>Everyone's life is important.</line>

<line>Not Vanessa's apparently.</line>

<line>Or Abbey's.</line>

<line>What kind of man
lets his sister take his b*llet?</line>

<line>You don't know about Abbey and me.</line>

<line>I know more than I want to know.</line>

<line>We had a hard upbringing.</line>

<line>Yeah, humble beginnings.</line>

<line>It was a lot worse than humble.</line>

<line>It made us very close.</line>

<line>I can't make you understand.</line>

<line>I don't need to understand that.</line>

<line>I just want the truth about Vanessa,
how she died.</line>

<line>You got a law degree, right.
You know about Miranda.</line>

<line>Yeah. / Well, I haven't Mirandized you,
so anything you tell me right now,</line>

<line>I can't use it in court.
You're protected.</line>

<line>And we can have a conversation.</line>

<line>About what? / The truth.</line>

<line>Why would you wanna
know something</line>

<line>you could do nothing about?</line>

<line>That's for me to know.</line>

<line>What you need to know is
I ain't leaving till you tell me.</line>

<line>I thought that she had left the party.</line>

<line>I never expected to see her again.</line>

<line>Vanessa,</line>

<line>what are you doing here?</line>

<line>I went to Redding this weekend.</line>

<line>I met Marvin Dobie.</line>

<line>Why would you do that?</line>

<line>I just wanted to know
what was coming between us.</line>

<line>What did he say?</line>

<line>It doesn't matter.</line>

<line>What did he say?</line>

<line>He told me.</line>

<line>About you and Abbey.</line>

<line>It's all right.</line>

<line>Vanessa, we can't.</line>

<line>I can't.</line>

<line>We can.</line>

<line>We can be together.</line>

<line>You just have to look forward
and not back.</line>

<line>I love you.</line>

<line>I can't.</line>

<line>V.</line>

<line>Oh god, Vanessa.</line>

<line>Abbey.</line>
