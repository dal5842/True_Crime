<xml><line>Well. To boys,</line>

<line>Here's to
buying cheap and</line>

<line>selling dear.</line>

<line>Selling?</line>

<line>I sold our positions in Navrax</line>

<line>right before the plummet.</line>

<line>Why didn't you tell us?
- Couldn't risk the leak.</line>

<line>Timing is everything.</line>

<line>Had to get out
before the lemmings.</line>

<line>There he is.
- The Kipster.</line>

<line>We have a problem.
- What now, kiddo?</line>

<line>We're celebrating.
- It's important.</line>

<line>Everything's important to you, Kip.</line>

<line>And nothing is important to you.</line>

<line>The mouse roars.</line>

<line>People are losing their
shirts on Navrax.</line>

<line>Well, I got my shirt.</line>

<line>Ascot Chang, it's tailor-made.</line>

<line>Please, Charlie.</line>

<line>We have to talk.
- All right, all right.</line>

<line>Sit down.
Take a load off.</line>

<line>Keep 'em coming, Vicky.</line>

<line>Yes, sir, Mr. Danville.</line>

<line>Nice tail on that one.</line>

<line>To lives of quiet desperation</line>

<line>and not leading them.</line>

<line>Thanks for coming.</line>

<line>You could've just
cancelled over the phone.</line>

<line>Cancel? And miss the chance
of seeing Tripod and Cyclops?</line>

<line>Who says you're gonna see them?</line>

<line>I'm an optimist.</line>

<line>So, um, this guy is a friend of
my older brother's, Randy Price.</line>

<line>Got in the jam with the SEC, FBI.</line>

<line>Enron type scandal.
Now he wants to cut a deal.</line>

<line>He's got something
on the homicide?</line>

<line>Charles Danville, .</line>

<line>Never heard of him.
- Big financial wizard back in the day.</line>

<line>Now Randy is in danger of going
the way of Martha Stewart.</line>

<line>What are you talking about?</line>

<line>Get your feet off my desk and
your a*s out of my chair, Randy.</line>

<line>Geez, Kite.</line>

<line>Is that any way to
treat an old pal?</line>

<line>Detective Rush,
Randy Price.</line>

<line>You're a homicide detective?</line>

<line>I gotta start committing
some real crimes.</line>

<line>Enough of this white collar crap.</line>

<line>You got something
you wanna tell me, Randy?</line>

<line>I've got something amazing.</line>

<line>I know who k*lled Charles Danville.</line>

<line>Okay, fine.</line>

<line>You don't wanna solve the m*rder of
one of the biggest names on Market Street,</line>

<line>I can take this
info elsewhere.</line>

<line>Door's that way.</line>

<line>You told me this lady was
top notch, Kite.</line>

<line>She is.</line>

<line>Look, detective.</line>

<line>Before all this unpleasantness
with SEC occurred,</line>

<line>I was senior vice president
of mergers and aquisitions.</line>

<line>I'm really busy, Randy.</line>

<line>Two weeks before Danville was k*lled,
I was in the john of this hotel.</line>

<line>Son of a b*tch,
you lost it all.</line>

<line>Do I know you?
- Stu Livermore.</line>

<line>I invested grand in Bentech
and now look at this.</line>

<line>It's worthless.</line>

<line>You run the dry cleaners.</line>

<line>You begged me to let you invest.</line>

<line>Because you were supposed to be
the big shot with all the inside information.</line>

<line>Well, did you read
the perspectives?</line>

<line>Because it clearly states
the risks involved.</line>

<line>I need that money back.</line>

<line>All right, all right.</line>

<line>Stu, is it?</line>

<line>Maybe,</line>

<line>just maybe if I pull a few strings,
I can get you into Navrax.</line>

<line>What's Navrax?</line>

<line>It's a sure thing.</line>

<line>You already wiped me out, remember?
I don't have any more money.</line>

<line>You must think I'm really stupid.
- Not stupid, desperate.</line>

<line>And Navrax is your way out.</line>

<line>Trust me.</line>

<line>Don't let me pressure you.</line>

<line>You sure about this Navrax?
- Hey,</line>

<line>ou got a better way out?</line>

<line>Take it.</line>

<line>I got a life insurance policy.
It's worth about grand.</line>

<line>But I warn you.</line>

<line>This Navrax bombs,</line>

<line>you're gonna pay with your life,</line>

<line>trust me.</line>

<line>What happened to Navrax?</line>

<line>It crashed and burned.</line>

<line>Two weeks after Livermore invested.</line>

<line>Same time Danville got k*lled.</line>

<line>I told you it was good.</line>

<line>Well, why didn't you let the
cops know about it back then?</line>

<line>How would I profit from that?</line>

<line>I was saving it for a rainy day.</line>

<line>And now, it's pouring.</line>

<line>Theory in ' was
a car jacking gone wrong.</line>

<line>Danville's body was found
in an alley off the Market Street.</line>

<line>I remember Danville.</line>

<line>He was all over the business
section back in the ' 's.</line>

<line>His Delorean was found the next day
in Ardmore, miles away.</line>

<line>Junked and stripped.</line>

<line>Lotta high end cars got
jacked in ' .</line>

<line>Yeah, they busted a ring of guys for
exporting car parts overseas that year.</line>

<line>Details of the theft match
up with the MO in all the others,</line>

<line>except this one
left a victim.</line>

<line>And that pal of Kite's,
Randy Price..</line>

<line>A ' 's throw back,</line>

<line>a real Market Street,
'greed is good' type.</line>

<line>But he's got information?</line>

<line>This story about Livermore waving
that g*n around is pretty interesting.</line>

<line>Maybe Livermore shot Danville,</line>

<line>took the Delorean to
make it look like a car jacking.</line>

<line>Scotty and I'll track down Livermore,
see what he has to say.</line>

<line>Want me and Vera to go talk
to the last-to-see?</line>

<line>Who was it?
- Victoria Jordan,</line>

bartender at a place
<line>called Arbitrage.</line>

<line>I've been there
with my stockbroker.</line>

<line>You're in the market, boss?</line>

<line>Half of America is, Lil.</line>

<line>Not my half.</line>

<line>I'll give my broker a call,</line>

<line>see what he know about Danville
and company he used to work for.</line>

<line>Stu Livermore?</line>

<line>Detectives Rush
and Valens.</line>

<line>Hey, finders keepers.</line>

<line>It ain't illegal colllecting
discarded tickets.</line>

<line>We wanna talk to you
about Charles Danville.</line>

<line>Danville.</line>

<line>That lying huckster ruined my life.</line>

<line>We heard.</line>

<line>You been talking to my ex.</line>

<line>She told us
where to find you.</line>

<line>You had a run-in with him
June, th, .</line>

<line>Swore that if Navrax bombs,
you'd k*ll him.</line>

<line>That's right.</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>You think I made
good on that threat?</line>

<line>You shoved the g*n to his chest.</line>

<line>Should've fired it too.</line>

<line>But instead I invested
another grand with him.</line>

<line>Two weeks later,
that was gone too.</line>

<line>Mr. Livermore?</line>

<line>Hey. Kip Krowley,
I'm an associate of Mr. Danville's.</line>

<line>I don't want an associate,
I want Danville.</line>

<line>Mr. Danville is
extremely busy. / Yeah,</line>

<line>busy robbing on
his people like me.</line>

<line>I went to the headquarters
in Navrax Corporation.</line>

<line>You know what I found?</line>

<line>One..</line>

<line>One old lady in an -by-
office answering the phone.</line>

<line>That's Navrax.</line>

<line>An old lady with a phone.</line>

<line>You..You must be mistaken.</line>

<line>No mistake. / Well, I'm sure
that there's an explanation.</line>

<line>That money was going to
pay for my children's education.</line>

<line>My wife's gonna leave me.</line>

<line>I'd k*ll myself,
but that wouldn't do any good.</line>

<line>I've already cashed in
on my life insurance.</line>

<line>Hey, I..</line>

<line>I'm very sorry.</line>

<line>Please, I'm begging you.</line>

<line>If I don't get that money back.</line>

<line>Just.. you give me your number,
Mr. Livermore, okay?</line>

<line>I personally gurantee Mr. Danville
will look into this and call you.</line>

<line>When?
- End of the day.</line>

<line>Tomorrow morning at the latest.</line>

<line>I give you my word.</line>

<line>I was sitting by the phone
all that day like a chump</line>

<line>waiting for that kid to come through.</line>

<line>I got the brush-off.
I finally went to bed.</line>

<line>And I saw the story on
the morning news.</line>

<line>But you never got
your money back?</line>

<line>Guess I could've hired a lawyer,</line>

try to sue, you know,
<line>if I had a cent to my name.</line>

<line>But I didn't.</line>

<line>Still don't.</line>

<line>You were the last person
to see Charles Danville alive?</line>

<line>Yeah, around two am.</line>

<line>Saw him walk out that door
like every night.</line>

<line>Anyone with him?</line>

<line>Nope.
Lost Boys left earlier.</line>

<line>Lost Boys? / Yeah.</line>

<line>Danville had a group of young
boys that worshipped him.</line>

<line>Fed his ego. / From Collins Brothers,
the firm where he worked?</line>

<line>They wished.</line>

<line>Danville's boys weren't Ivy League.</line>

<line>They were wannabes.
On the outside looking in,</line>

<line>until Danville took pity on them
about a month before he died.</line>

<line>He had met them before? / No,</line>

<line>not that I knew of at least,</line>

<line>but he got real friendly, real fast.</line>

<line>Wonder when
I'll ever be those boys.</line>

<line>Yeah. Galaxy far far away.</line>

<line>Go get some stock tips.</line>

<line>Holy crap,
that is Charles Danville.</line>

<line>He's.. he's coming our way.</line>

<line>Be cool.</line>

<line>Mr. Danville.</line>

<line>Can we buy you a drink?</line>

<line>You guys from Blaine?</line>

<line>Yeah, but how could you tell?</line>

<line>Well, to start,</line>

<line>You're dressed like
used car salesmen,</line>

<line>you're at the bar, because</line>

<line>you can only
afford an appetizer</line>

<line>and you're gawking at the swells</line>

<line>like they're different species.</line>

<line>Which they are.</line>

<line>Except for me.</line>

<line>I used to work in a sweat shop
just like Blaine back in the day.</line>

<line>Cold caling chumps for
ten dollar commissions.</line>

<line>So how did you get to
where you are?</line>

<line>Cajones.</line>

<line>Big brass ones.</line>

<line>You guys got 'em?</line>

<line>Yeah, we got going it. Yeah.</line>

<line>Good. Cause if you're hungry,
maybe I can help you out.</line>

<line>Seriously?</line>

<line>I'm putting together a bond offering
for a company called Navrax.</line>

<line>You know Navrax?</line>

<line>Yeah, of course.</line>

<line>Navrax is awesome.</line>

<line>You're crappy liars.</line>

<line>But you'll get better.</line>

<line>Stick with me, I'll teach you
how to sell snow to eskimos.</line>

<line>You'll be millionaires
by the end of summer.</line>

<line>Interested?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Why would a big shot like Danville
wanna associate with nobodies?</line>

<line>Maybe he saw himself
in those boys.</line>

<line>Maybe he was just slumming.</line>

<line>All I know was,</line>

<line>the day he died, we got stuck
with thousand dollar tab.</line>

<line>grand,</line>

<line>worth more than my car.</line>

<line>Way more.
- Owner of the Arbitage at the time,</line>

<line>he thought Danville was
made of money.</line>

<line>Just too busy to get
around to paying it.</line>

<line>Me, I would never
have let that happen.</line>

<line>The owner still around?
- Sold the place, to me.</line>

<line>And I don't give credit to no one.</line>

<line>Four bucks.</line>

<line>So Mackie's your broker, huh?</line>

<line>He told you where to find me?</line>

<line>So Danville worked for you
for what, six years?</line>

<line>Something like that.</line>

<line>Thought he got k*lled
in the car jacking.</line>

<line>Well, we're taking
another look at that.</line>

<line>My detectives talked
to a woman at the Arbitrage</line>

<line>and said the guy was a louse,</line>

<line>welched on his debts.</line>

<line>Sounds about right.
- I thought Danville was a heavy hitter.</line>

<line>Rolling in dough.</line>

<line>For a while.</line>

<line>Then he hit a losing streak.
Every stock he hyped went in the toilet.</line>

<line>That's why we fired him.</line>

<line>Fired?</line>

<line>Wasn't he still the employee
of the Collins Brothers when he died?</line>

<line>On paper, he was.</line>

<line>But he begged us to let
him stay unsalaried</line>

<line>until he can get another gig going.</line>

<line>So Danville was on the ropes.</line>

<line>Day he died, we had to cover
about half a mil of his debts</line>

<line>to protect the firm's reputation.</line>

<line>Keep up the appearances.</line>

<line>And keep the authorities off
our backs checking records.</line>

<line>Fat lot of good
it did us considering</line>

<line>I got popped for insider trading.</line>

<line>Well, it could've been worse.</line>

<line>You could've ended up like Danville.</line>

<line>Broke? / Dead.</line>

<line>So Danville's broke
but still playing the big shot?</line>

<line>Yeah, scrambling to get the
Navrax deal off the ground</line>

<line>while his reputation's still intact and</line>

he still had an office
<line>at Collins Brothers.</line>

<line>So this guy's all tabbed out,
but he's still got a corporate apartment,</line>

tab in the five star restaurant
<line>and a Delorean to push around?</line>

<line>How do I get this job.</line>

<line>Now, how come the assigned didn't look
at the disgruntled investors for this?</line>

<line>Car jacking theory looked solid.
- Collins Brothers covered for Danville.</line>

<line>They erased the
paper trail of his debts.</line>

<line>And plus white collar criminal
ususally get sued, not shot.</line>

<line>So, maybe the doer isn't
your typical investor.</line>

<line>Let's check the SEC records.</line>

<line>See if anyone with a criminal
record bought shares with Navrax.</line>

<line>We'll go talk to Danville's
old associates.</line>

<line>The Lost boys. / Start with the kid that
was supposed to get back to Livemore.</line>

<line>Kip.</line>

<line>Kip Krowley?</line>

<line>Detective Rush and Valens.</line>

<line>It's about Charles Danville.</line>

<line>Charlie Danville?</line>

<line>That was a life time ago.</line>

<line>We've been talking to an old
associate of yours,</line>

<line>Randy Price.
- Oh yeah, I read about Randy.</line>

<line>He's in trouble with the SEC, huh?</line>

<line>He says Stu Livermore
threatened Danville's life.</line>

<line>No kidding.</line>

<line>We know you dealt with Livermore
in ' running interference for Danville.</line>

<line>But you never told
the cops about that.</line>

<line>Well, Charlie was k*lled
in a car jacking.</line>

<line>What would Livermore
have to do with that?</line>

<line>Did you know he pulled
a g*n on Danville</line>

<line>two weeks before his death?</line>

<line>No, I didn't.</line>

<line>I just felt bad for the guy.</line>

<line>Did you talk to him?
Is he making out?</line>

<line>He's collecting used tickets
off the floor at the OTB.</line>

<line>That's a shame.</line>

<line>I tried to talk to Charlie
about him the night that he died.</line>

<line>To lives of a quiet desperation.</line>

<line>And not leading them.</line>

<line>So, kiddo.</line>

<line>What's so important that can't wait?</line>

<line>I went to the headquarters
at the Navrax Corporation.</line>

<line>This about the drycleaner mope?
- Livermore.</line>

<line>And he was right.
It's nothing.</line>

<line>Nothing. It's an old lady
answering phones.</line>

<line>So?</line>

<line>It's the idea that counts.</line>

<line>Not the the brick and mortar.</line>

<line>Charlie.</line>

<line>I promised Livermore that
you would call him.</line>

<line>I personally guaranteed..</line>

<line>Don't promise things, kiddo.</line>

<line>Can you help him?</line>

<line>Please.</line>

<line>For me.</line>

<line>That's good.</line>

<line>Kip.</line>

<line>Going for the heart like that?</line>

<line>I actually have taught you something.</line>

<line>So you will talk to him? / No.</line>

<line>Hey,</line>

<line>I'm a heartless bastard, remember?</line>

<line>No, you're not.</line>

<line>You are too good to be true.</line>

<line>Kiddo, have a drink.</line>

<line>Lighten up.</line>

<line>That was the last time that I saw him.</line>

<line>I walked to the train and
went to my mom's.</line>

<line>Danville sounds like he was telling the
truth about being a heartless bastard, huh?</line>

<line>Nah, that was just his way.</line>

<line>He was training me to be like him.</line>

<line>Were you upset when he died?</line>

<line>Broken up.</line>

<line>Like I said,</line>

<line>he was trying to
teach me to suceed.</line>

<line>Wasn't his fault I couldn't
cut it in his world.</line>

<line>These are records from the SEC.</line>

<line>About people invested
in Navrax back in ' .</line>

<line>Most for a thousand bucks or so.</line>

<line>And only a dozen
went in for grand.</line>

<line>Anyone with a record?</line>

<line>Yeah, one.
Teddy Mars.</line>

<line>Served years for dealing
cocaine in the late ' 's.</line>

<line>And another three for manslaughter,
broke a guy's neck in Frackville.</line>

<line>How does a ?? like Mars get into
business with a highroller like Danville.</line>

<line>If he was selling
cocaine to Danville.</line>

<line>Danville was broke.</line>

<line>Maybe there was
some bartering going on.</line>

<line>And cocaine for stocks?</line>

<line>And if those investments tanked?
- Mars would come collecting.</line>

<line>The old fashioned way.</line>

<line>Check with his parole officer
see if he's got a good address.</line>

<line>Teddy Mars.</line>

<line>Wanna talk to you about
Charles Danville.</line>

<line>You ain't Vice.</line>

<line>And you don't look like Narcs.</line>

<line>Homicide. / You invested grand in the
complany Danville was selling called Navrax.</line>

<line>Hold up.</line>

<line>Let me get my lawyer down here.
We can have a real nice pow wow,</line>

<line>just the four of us.</line>

<line>While you're on the line,
we'll talk to your boys over there.</line>

<line>What boys?
- The ones that are dealing for you?</line>

<line>You got me wrong detectives.</line>

<line>I'm an artist now.</line>

<line>Suit yourself, Teddy.</line>

<line>With what they're holding,
you're coming with us.</line>

<line>So how'd you get
involved with Danville?</line>

<line>That ain't a secret.</line>

<line>For a time I supplied
all the joints in Market Street.</line>

<line>Including Arbitrage?
- Especially Arbitrage.</line>

<line>Them Brooks Brothers types
liked to party.</line>

<line>Teddy.</line>

<line>You should get on
this Navrax.</line>

<line>Make some fortune.
- You wanna taste the merchandise?</line>

<line>How much for the whole ounce?</line>

<line>Boys deserve a treat.</line>

<line>Ounce is three grand.</line>

<line>You already owe me ten.</line>

<line>You know what,</line>

<line>I'm gonna cut you in on
this Navrax deal for thousand.</line>

<line>Couple of months,
it'll be worth twice that,</line>

- maybe three times.
<line>Yeah, you do that.</line>

<line>After you pay me
the grand in cash.</line>

<line>I'll give that think through. / Teddy,</line>

<line>- this Navrax is like money in the bank.
- You don't got it, do you?</line>

<line>I'm offering you grand
in bonds for .</line>

<line>Give me your Rolex.</line>

<line>Teddy, come on.</line>

<line>Imma take your watch</line>

<line>and your worthless paper.</line>

<line>But hours,</line>

<line>I want my K in cash.</line>

<line>So did you get your money?</line>

<line>Next day.</line>

<line>One of Charlie's boys
delivered a briefcase full of green.</line>

<line>You happen to remember
who gave you the money?</line>

<line>Yeah, the pretty boy.
Beau something.</line>

<line>Look, if you don't believe me, ask him.</line>

<line>He'd tell you.
I got paid.</line>

<line>I didn't k*ll Charlie.
Cuz I had no reason to.</line>

<line>I may have met a Mr. Mars
back in the ' 's.</line>

<line>I couldn't say for sure.</line>

<line>We're Homicide, Beau.</line>

<line>Not Narcotics.
- Or the SEC.</line>

<line>Well, then.</line>

<line>Hell, yeah, I remember Teddy.</line>

<line>He was our supplier.</line>

<line>Did Danville send you to him
with a briefcase full of money?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>And he was pissed about it too.</line>

<line>We were coining it on Navrax,</line>

<line>but Charlie hated to
part with the actual cash.</line>

<line>So why did he?</line>

<line>Cuz Charlie could take the heat
from the blue ?? ladies or ??.</line>

<line>But Teddy Mars was
a different story.</line>

<line>So you knew Danville was a swindler?</line>

<line>I looked the other way.</line>

<line>You any other investors that
might want to see Danville dead?</line>

<line>Investors?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Then who?</line>

<line>After I gave Teddy the cash,</line>

<line>I went back to Charlie to
return his Rolex.</line>

<line>Our brave boy,
back from the trenches.</line>

<line>The guy scared the piss out of me.</line>

<line>Sit down,
take a load off.</line>

<line>Help yourself.</line>

<line>Thanks.</line>

<line>I got your watch back.</line>

<line>I want you to keep it.</line>

<line>Token of my appreciation.</line>

<line>Seriously.</line>

<line>You're the one, Beau.</line>

<line>You're the one who's
gonna make it big.</line>

<line>I am? / I don't think
the others have what it takes.</line>

<line>But you,</line>

<line>you know what it takes.</line>

<line>Don't you?</line>

<line>That's when I got out.</line>

<line>Danville hit on anyone else
you know of?</line>

<line>He hit on all of us.</line>

<line>If you wanted to succeed with Charlie,
you play by his rules.</line>

<line>And that meant sleeping with him?</line>

<line>If you wanted to get ahead,</line>

<line>that's what it meant.</line>

<line>Want a deal, Randy,
you start talking.</line>

<line>And you tell all.
No more saving for a rainy day.</line>

<line>Livermore didn't k*ll Danville.</line>

<line>I know what I heard.</line>

<line>You know what we heard?</line>

<line>Danville liked boys.</line>

<line>Young ones.
Up-and-comers, like you.</line>

<line>He hit on you, Randy?
Cuz he hit on Beau.</line>

<line>Yeah, but Beau didn't k*ll him.</line>

<line>He's got an alibi.</line>

<line>He was at his girlfriend's
the night Danville got dead.</line>

<line>But you, you don't
have a alibi, do you?</line>

<line>Wait a minute.
You think I k*lled Danville?</line>

<line>That's insane.</line>

<line>So, you like biting the pillow.</line>

<line>You didn't get horizontal
to make it to Homicide?</line>

<line>Guy's worthless.</line>

<line>This deal's off.</line>

<line>Okay, okay.
Cool your jets.</line>

<line>God.</line>

<line>Did I service Danville to get ahead?</line>

<line>Yeah, so what?</line>

<line>So maybe you felt
humiliated by that.</line>

<line>Decided to g*n down the man
who made you catch for him.</line>

<line>I did what I had to do.</line>

<line>Big deal.
- You got anything more on Danville,</line>

<line>you wanna say it right now, Randy.
Cuz your deal is going south, fast.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>All right.</line>

<line>This is the entire truth.</line>

<line>Well, that's big for Randy.</line>

<line>I met Danville earlier
than I said before.</line>

<line>How much earlier?</line>

<line>Little more than a month
before he was k*lled.</line>

<line>You want a ride?</line>

<line>Hey, you're Charles Danville.</line>

<line>That's right.</line>

<line>And you work for Blaine &amp; Sons.</line>

<line>How do you know that?</line>

<line>I used to have a crappy
umbrella just like that.</line>

<line>Hop in.</line>

<line>This is so cool.</line>

<line>Took me hard days
of work to afford it.</line>

<line>Do you think I'm kidding?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>You know, I used to work
for a joint like Blaine.</line>

<line>Back in the day.
- Seriously?</line>

<line>Till I wised up,
took some risks.</line>

<line>You a risk taker, uh..?</line>

<line>Randy.</line>

<line>Randy Price.</line>

<line>Yeah, I like risk.</line>

<line>Good, Randy.</line>

<line>Then I'm gonna
make you a proposition.</line>

<line>I'm gonna create a company
at thin air, sell the hell out of it.</line>

<line>Can you do that?</line>

<line>I'm Charles Danville.</line>

<line>I can do anything.</line>

<line>Still looking for a couple salesmen.</line>

<line>You know anyone
who might be interested?</line>

<line>So Danville meeting you,</line>

<line>Kip and Beau at the Arbitrage,
that was a setup?</line>

<line>Yep. Worked like a charm, too.</line>

<line>And Beau and Kip never knew
Navrax was bogus?</line>

<line>Beau knew it was
a boiler room scam,</line>

<line>but he didn't care
so long as he making out.</line>

<line>And Kip?</line>

<line>Kip was a fool.</line>

<line>Out of his depth.</line>

<line>Believed every word Danville said.</line>

<line>Why'd you keep
this from us, Randy?</line>

<line>Because it was a crooked deal.</line>

<line>And I'm facing charges of
invested fraud.</line>

<line>Okay, you know what,</line>

<line>I just remembered something.
And this is good.</line>

<line>Hey, feel that?</line>

<line>It's raining again.</line>

<line>Kip Krowley the dummy,
he got his mother to invest in Navrax</line>

<line>and she lost a bundle.</line>

<line>Oh we've seen the list of investors,
there's no Krowley.</line>

<line>No, Danville told me she invested.</line>

<line>He bragged about closing the deal.</line>

<line>Hey, your boyfriend in there
was telling the truth.</line>

<line>It's too bad.</line>

<line>Kip's mum did invest in Navrax.</line>

<line>She went by Mavis Breen,
not Krowley.</line>

    <line>How much'd she drop? grand.</line>

<line>That's worth a conversation.</line>

<line>What? You got plans?</line>

<line>Kind of.</line>

<line>You got plans?</line>

<line>You kidding?
I'm married.</line>

<line>I'd take any excuse
not to go home.</line>

<line>I wish you boys would've
given me some warning.</line>

<line>Would've made myself presentable.</line>

<line>We just wanted to ask you
about Navrax, Mrs. Breen.</line>

<line>Mavis, please.</line>

<line>I'm divorced.</line>

<line>Can you tell us how you came
to invest in the company, Mavis?</line>

<line>You'd have to
ask Kip about Navrax.</line>



<line>Well, we'd rather talk to you.</line>

<line>Kip isn't in any trouble, is he?</line>

<line>Cuz if he is,
it's my fault.</line>

<line>And how does that work?</line>

<line>Well, when it comes to men,</line>

<line>I make terrible choices.</line>

<line>And poor Kip had to suffer
through my divorces ??</line>

<line>all four of them.</line>

<line>So, about Navrax,</line>

<line>Kip told you to invest?</line>

<line>He knew I had some money in
the bank from my last settlement.</line>

<line>He just wanted to help me grow it.</line>

<line>Did you ever meet Charles Danville?</line>

<line>He took Kip and me to dinner.</line>

<line>You know, to make his pitch.</line>

<line>Chin chin.</line>

<line>What is this?</line>

<line>Well, that is called sushi, Ms. Breen.</line>

<line>Oh, it's Mavis.</line>

<line>Why isn't it cooked?</line>

<line>Oh, it's cutting edge.</line>

<line>Raw's the next big thing.</line>

<line>Well, I prefer chicken teriyaki.</line>

<line>Mum., Charlie has a great
investment opportunity for you.</line>

<line>It's a company called Navrax, Mavis.</line>

<line>High tech.</line>

<line>Japanese are interested
in investing, right, Charlie?</line>

<line>But I promise you
it has nothing to do with sushi.</line>

<line>Charlie's a genious, mum.</line>

<line>He's a senior VP at Collins Brothers.</line>

<line>I've heard of Collins Brothers.</line>

<line>I'm old news.</line>

<line>Kip here is the future.</line>

<line>No thanks to you, huh?</line>

<line>I may have helped out a little bit.</line>

<line>Charlie is my mentor, mum.</line>

<line>You flatter me, kiddo.</line>

<line>I certainly appreciate
your taking interest in my boy.</line>

<line>But when it comes to investing,
I'm all for cautious.</line>

<line>Well, your mum's just my lady, Kip.</line>

<line>It's obviously going
to take more than one dinner</line>

<line>to get her to see the
wisdom of investing.</line>

<line>So, Danville convinced you?</line>

<line>Eventually.</line>

<line>I really invested for Kip's sake.</line>

<line>You know, to help
advance his career.</line>

<line>Lot of good that did.</line>

<line>You must've been pretty angry
losing all that money.</line>

<line>Furious.
- How about Kip?</line>

<line>He was devastated.</line>

<line>He really believed in that Danville.</line>

<line>So in your defense,
he took revenge on Danville.</line>

<line>Oh no, my Kip couldn't hurt a fly.</line>

<line>Me, on the other hand,</line>

<line>I wanted to string Danville
up by his lying neck.</line>

<line>But of course I didn't.</line>

<line>Man was dad
before I could buy a rope.</line>

<line>Your friend Price is a real prince.</line>

<line>He's my brother's friend.</line>

<line>And he's always been a low life.</line>

<line>Well, he's saint
compared to Danville.</line>

<line>That's the j.o.b.</line>

<line>We don't get to pick our victims.</line>

<line>So, you</line>

<line>wanna go see another
movie tomorrow night?</line>

<line>It's first Thursdays, tomorrow.</line>

<line>First what?</line>

<line>First Thursday of every month,
the homicide detectives get together,</line>

- retired and active.
<line>To do what?</line>

<line>Talk.</line>

<line>Drink.</line>

<line>Sounds fun,
bring me along.</line>

<line>I don't know, Kite.</line>

<line>You're not in the Hat Squad.</line>

<line>You guys have more weird
names for yourselves.</line>

<line>It's usually just cops.</line>

<line>Well, I'm a friend of a cop.</line>

<line>You wanna see the girls?</line>

<line>Met your mum, Kip.</line>

<line>You did. / Heard how she lost
a cool K to Navrax.</line>

<line>Oh boy. / You forgot to
mention that to us, did ya.</line>

<line>Well, I didn't tell you because I thought
it would look like I k*lled Charlie.</line>

<line>It does.
- And that's just the half of it.</line>

<line>What do you mean?
- Randy Price, Beau Munger,</line>

<line>they say Danville was
a sexual predator.</line>

<line>They said that?</line>

<line>Come on, Kip.
Quit the act.</line>

<line>You worshipped Danville.</line>

<line>Not only did he use you
to get to your mum's money..</line>

<line>He hit on you too.</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>That's not how it went.</line>

<line>You really think I should buy it?</line>

<line>Hell yes, I think you should buy it.</line>

<line>Maybe I should save the money
that we're making off Navrax.</line>

<line>No, no, kiddo.</line>

<line>There's plenty more
where that came from.</line>

<line>I do love it.
- Then buy it.</line>

<line>You derserve it. / Yeah?</line>

<line>I'm really proud of you, you know.</line>

<line>You've come a long way.</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>Hey, kiddo,
you stick with me.</line>

<line>You're gonna rule
Market Street one day.</line>

<line>Follow right in my footsteps.</line>

<line>Come on, kiddo.
Let's grab the bull by its horns.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>I gotta tell you something.</line>

<line>The car's not the
only thing that I love.</line>

<line>I love you, too.</line>

<line>I love you, too, kiddo.</line>

<line>No, I mean</line>

<line>I really love you.</line>

<line>Charlie didn't hit on me.</line>

<line>I hit on him.</line>

<line>Now that must've surprised Danville.</line>

<line>He was surprised.</line>

<line>But then we fell in love.</line>

<line>You buy that Mustang?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Charlie and I drove
all over town in it.</line>

<line>I wanted to spend the rest
of my life with him.</line>

    <line>So the thought of me k*lling him is so crazy.</line>



<line>I loved him,</line>

<line>I still do.</line>

<line>Yeah, Kip said he took trains to
his mum's the night, Danville died.</line>

<line>Yeah.
- There's a reason.</line>

<line>I ran all the car jackings
in June of ' ,</line>

<line>no mustang is stole in Philly.</line>

<line>But in Montgomery county
where Kip's mum lived..</line>

<line>Cherry red mustang?
- Junked and stripped.</line>

<line>Guess where?
- Ardmore.</line>

<line>Just like all the other
car jackings.</line>

<line>Including Danville's Delorean.</line>

<line>Pretty amazing coincidence.</line>

<line>How'd they miss this in ' ?</line>

<line>Montgomery County and Philly
were like two separate countries, Scotty.</line>

<line>So maybe Kip's playing us
using love as a alibi.</line>

<line>Let's bring the math teacher
in this time.</line>

<line>See whether he likes our house.</line>

<line>This is wrong.</line>

<line>Why are you doing this to me?</line>

<line>He's excellent.
- Sure you don't teach drama?</line>

<line>I'm telling you the truth.</line>

<line>I didn't k*ll Charlie.
Why do you think that?</line>

<line>Well, cuz your precious
cherry red Mustang was car jacked</line>

<line>a few days before Charlie was k*lled.</line>

<line>So you knew exactly how
to cover up a m*rder</line>

<line>and make it look like
a car jacking.</line>

<line>Was it spur of the moment, Kip,
or premeditated?</line>

<line>I left Charlie at the Arbitrage alive</line>

<line>and then I went to the train station
jsut like I told you.</line>

<line>I believe you left the bar, Kip.</line>

<line>Then you waited outside for
Danville to leave.</line>

<line>Shot him twice and took off
in his Delorean.</line>

<line>No, that's not what happened.
- So what did happen?</line>

<line>The night he was k*lled I,</line>

<line>I kept at him.</line>

<line>I confronted him one last time.</line>

<line>Charlie.</line>

<line>We're having
a conversation here, Kip.</line>

<line>I'm not leaving till we talk.</line>

<line>What's bothering you now?</line>

<line>If you won't help Livermore..
- Get over Livermore.</line>

<line>At least tell me that the
thousand my mum invested,</line>

<line>you're not gonna scam her too.</line>

<line>Your mum already received
a return on her investment.</line>

<line>What do you mean?</line>

<line>Ask her.</line>

<line>Charlie, you're really
confusing me here.</line>

<line>Is, is my mother gonna get
her money back or not?</line>

<line>No, Kip.</line>

<line>She's not.</line>

<line>But she's my mother.</line>

<line>And she is not some stranger
like Livermore.</line>

<line>I thought that you cared
about us, I mean me.</line>

<line>I do, kiddo.</line>

<line>That's why you need to listen
to me very closely.</line>

<line>This game ain't for you.
Get out while you're still young.</line>

<line>Go back to the sticks.</line>

<line>Become a librarian.</line>

<line>Something more your speed.</line>

<line>You're kidding, right?</line>

<line>I wanted to help you
but you're just not catching on.</line>

<line>Charlie.
- It's over.</line>

<line>No sale.
- But I love you.</line>

<line>Sorry.</line>

<line>So long, kiddo.</line>

<line>I left there crying like a baby.</line>

<line>Never saw Charlie again.</line>

<line>Says you.</line>

<line>I went to my mum's.</line>

<line>Like I told you.</line>

<line>When it comes to alibis,</line>

<line>a mother's pretty close to worthless.</line>

<line>I can't confess to
a m*rder I didn't commit.</line>

<line>Why don't you believe me?</line>

<line>What are you doing here?</line>

<line>Kip's in custody for m*rder
of Charles Danville, Mavis.</line>

<line>Oh no.</line>

<line>No, that's not right.</line>

<line>Kip did not do anything.</line>

<line>We know about Kip's car
getting jacked.</line>

<line>So what?</line>

<line>That doesn't prove anything.</line>

<line>So you knew about that, too.</line>

<line>Well, of course I knew.</line>

<line>Mavis, there are ways of tesifying
that you could help Kip,</line>

<line>reduce his sentence.</line>

<line>He seems like a decent guy
jury will respond to that.</line>

<line>Seems?</line>

<line>That boy's an angel.</line>

<line>All the same,
he k*lled a man in cold blood.</line>

<line>And left him to die in the road.</line>

<line>That boy is an angel.</line>

<line>And,</line>

<line>and Danville</line>

<line>was the devil.</line>

<line>I'm sorry, mum.</line>

<line>So sorry.</line>

<line>I don't care about the money.</line>

<line>I loved him.</line>

<line>I know.</line>

<line>Mum,</line>

<line>I really, really loved him.</line>

<line>You mean,</line>

<line>you and him?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>God, he used me and
spit me out like I'm nothing.</line>

<line>He told me that I was..</line>

<line>I wasn't cut out for the business
and just go back to the vegetable patch.</line>

<line>It's okay.</line>

<line>It's okay, baby.</line>

<line>It's okay.</line>

<line>Hello, Charlie.</line>

<line>Mavis.</line>

<line>What are you doing here?</line>

<line>Called the bar,</line>

<line>made sure you were
still here and sauced.</line>

<line>What do you want?</line>

<line>You. / Again?</line>

<line>I didn't give you enough
of the workout last night?</line>

<line>Yeah. That was a business.</line>

<line>You had to close a deal.</line>

<line>What, are you sore
about the money?</line>

<line>Forget the money.</line>

<line>I want you.</line>

<line>Look, Mavis, I'm a little tired.</line>

<line>Im an adult,</line>

<line>I got no one but myself to blame</line>

<line>for sleeping with
a cold blooded reptile like you.</line>

<line>But Kip's just a kid.</line>

<line>He's in his 's.
- He's a baby.</line>

<line>Look, why don't you just
put the g*n away. Okay?</line>

<line>We'll talk the whole thing through.</line>

<line>Sleep with a mother and her son?</line>

<line>This is low as it gets.</line>

<line>Kip doesn't have to know.
- He's never gonna know anything.</line>

<line>Just think you got what was
coming to ya</line>

<line>Kiddo.</line>
