<xml><line>Don't make me tie
you up, Red Feather.</line>

<line>Just come quiet and civilized.</line>

<line>We'll scalp you first, White Man.</line>

<line>Look.</line>

<line>Sister Vivian.</line>

<line>Sister Grace.</line>

<line>He's back.</line>

<line>Sheriff's back, men.</line>

<line>I'm sorry to hear that.</line>

<line>I'm sorry to hear that.</line>

<line>I know you're working on it.</line>

<line>Yeah, I miss you, too.</line>

<line>Boss has something.</line>

<line>Yeah, good.</line>

<line>Oh, I gotta jet, Elisa.</line>

<line>I'm gonna try to come this week.</line>

<line>Can't promise anything,
but best effort. Bye.</line>

<line>Someone left this on the
steps of St. Emilian's Church.</line>

"<line>Unknown boy found in box.</line>

<line>April , ."</line>

<line>Will, take a look at this.</line>

<line>Oh, that old job.</line>

<line>Boy in the box.</line>

<line>Even I heard of that one.</line>

<line>City's most famous cold job.</line>

<line>I've seen this up in
the comissioner's office.</line>

<line>Still nags the bosses.</line>

<line>They never so much
as I.D.'d the boy.</line>

<line>Everyone in Philly
knew about this kid.</line>

"<line>The unknown boy."</line>

<line>But week after week,</line>

<line>no one reported him missing,
and no one could name him.</line>

<line>Where's the body end up?</line>

<line>Charity Field... with
the paupers and prisoners.</line>

<line>Any tags on those?
- Nah.</line>

<line>Think the unknown boy
could be this little cowboy?</line>

<line>Lil, there's something on the back.</line>

"<line>His name was Arnold."</line>

"<line>Unknown white male, .</line>

<line>Dumped in Fox Chase."</line>

<line>Better known as the Boy in the Box.</line>

, circulars posted
<line>in Philadelphia and Bucks County.</line>

<line>Hundreds of leads,
none of them right.</line>

<line>Kid was found in a Liho
Punch box, out in a field.</line>

<line>They tried to trace the box in
Schools and restaurants.</line>

<line>They got nothing.</line>

<line>We know how he died?</line>

<line>Undetermined.</line>

<line>Look at the head wounds.</line>

<line>Look at the hair.</line>

<line>What's the deal?</line>

<line>One detective thought he was
k*lled while getting a haircut.</line>

<line>Homicidal barber?
That's a cracked theory.</line>

<line>Check this out.</line>

<line>Cops put the body in clothes,
propped him up</line>

<line>thinking it would make him
more recognizable.</line>

<line>Creepy.
- They didn't think so in ' .</line>

<line>Not that I was on the force then.</line>

<line>We weren't thinkin' that, Pops.</line>

<line>The college kid who found the box
turned into a frequent flyer.</line>

<line>He came to Homicide times
about the case.</line>

<line>Got obssessed?</line>

<line>Or was guilty about something.</line>

<line>Probably want to set
up visit number .</line>

<line>So who do we think
left the suitcase?</line>

<line>Someone who's been keeping
a secret a long time.</line>

<line>Let's see if we can
get prints off it.</line>

<line>We've got the name "Arnold",</line>

<line>and we've got this.</line>

<line>Maybe someone with younger eyes</line>

<line>can read the lettering on that bus?</line>

"<line>Fernwood Home for orphans."</line>

<line>Sisters Vivian Dole and Grace Ashley
ran the Fernwood Home in .</line>

<line>They still got orphanages in Philly?</line>

<line>No, we got the outstanding
foster care system instead.</line>

<line>Nuns. / What about them?</line>

<line>Tough ladies.</line>

<line>At least the ones who taught me.</line>

<line>I'm afraid Sister Grace died recently.</line>

<line>I'm sorry.</line>

<line>She gave years to the Church.
That's a life well-lived.</line>

<line>You and her ran
the Fernwood Orphanage in ?</line>

<line>From ' to ' .</line>

<line>We had up to boys and
girls at any given time.</line>

<line>You must know these boys, then.</line>

<line>They look like Fernwood children.</line>

<line>But I couldn't tell you the names.</line>

<line>How about a boy named Arnold?
Remember him?</line>

<line>Wore a cowboy hat?</line>

<line>It's possible.</line>

<line>I saw so many children
come and go, I just...</line>

<line>I don't remember them all.</line>

<line>Did you hear about the Boy
in the Box case, back in ' ?</line>

<line>I don't think so.</line>

<line>Kid was dumped in Fox Chase?</line>

<line>It was all over the city.</line>

<line>We lead private lives here.</line>

<line>We read morning prayers,
not morning papers.</line>

<line>We know the orphanage is gone now</line>

but there must be records
<line>from Fernwood somewhere.</line>

<line>I believe they're all
in the basement.</line>

<line>But I'm sure you don't want
to sift through all that.</line>

<line>Actually, we love that kind of thing.</line>

<line>Well, you're welcome to look.</line>

<line>There was one Arnold
at Fernwood that year,</line>

<line>Arnold Culliver.
Six years old.</line>

<line>So the Boy in the Box has a name.</line>

<line>We have intake and adoption
records for him.</line>

<line>Who adopted him?</line>

<line>Rubin and Lila Hanson, April .</line>

<line>Two days before he was
found in that field.</line>

<line>He was better off at the orphanage.</line>

<line>Those parents got a lot to explain.</line>

<line>We'll track them down.
I want to meet these people.</line>

<line>Arnold came to Fernwood in
' with a sister, Gretchen.</line>

<line>Can we find her?</line>

<line>There's a Gretchen Culliver
listed in, uh, Roxborough.</line>

<line>Working in the city library.</line>

<line>You get the names of those
other kids at Fernwood?</line>

<line>We can figure out who the
rest of these boys are.</line>

<line>Maybe if the sister gives her DNA,</line>

we exhume the boy's body,
<line>make a positive I.D.</line>

<line>We're gonna need an ADA's
help on this one, huh?</line>

<line>You know anyone?</line>

<line>Want to go talk to Gretchen?
- Sure thing.</line>

<line>Arnold Culliver was my brother,
but this isn't him.</line>

<line>I know it's hard to look at.</line>

<line>Well, that's not my brother.
Arnold had curls; blonde curls.</line>

<line>Is he one of these boys, Gretchen?</line>

<line>Yes, that's him with his
Science Club friends.</line>

<line>Where'd you get that?</line>

<line>Someone left it,
along with this circular.</line>

<line>Well, that dead boy can't be Arnold.</line>

<line>He was adopted in .</line>

<line>Sister Vivian said there's a family
coming that wants a little boy.</line>

<line>They can't have me.</line>

<line>I wish they wanted a girl, too.</line>

<line>I won't go, Gretch.
- You have to.</line>

<line>Even if we get separated.
You know our plan, right?</line>

<line>Meet at the horses.</line>

<line>When?</line>

<line>My th birthday.</line>

<line>Go to the Bryer Horse Fair,
meet you at the horses.</line>

<line>Don't forget.</line>

<line>I ain't leaving you, Gretch.</line>

<line>But he was gone one morning,</line>

<line>adopted late the night before.</line>

<line>I never said good-bye to him.</line>

<line>Did, uh, you go looking
for him at the horse fair?</line>

<line>I did, actually.</line>

<line>He didn't show.</line>

<line>It was a lucky Arnold found a home.</line>

<line>He acted up a lot.</line>

<line>There were two families before this one
who had taken him and brought him back.</line>

<line>Because of his behavior?</line>

<line>And if you got too old,
you didn't get adopted at all.</line>

<line>You were stuck at Fernwood.</line>

<line>That what happened to you?</line>

<line>Yeah, I grew up there.</line>

<line>Any idea where Arnold went to live?</line>

<line>Oh, they never told us
things like that.</line>

<line>I always imagined him with a nice
family on a horse farm somewhere.</line>

<line>So nice, he forgot Fernwood.</line>

<line>He was very young when he left.</line>

<line>Gretchen,</line>

would you be willing to
<line>give us a DNA sample</line>

<line>so we can compare it to this boy's?</line>

<line>Well, I'd be glad to but I
know that's not my brother.</line>

<line>I'd offer a refreshment, but
we don't got much in the house.</line>

<line>No problem.</line>

<line>So, what's it all about?</line>

<line>We got your name from
Gretchen Culliver, Roger.</line>

<line>From the Fernwood Home?</line>

<line>Gretchen...</line>

<line>Was she one of the older girls?</line>

<line>Yeah. Her brother Arnold,
he was your age.</line>

<line>Oh, sure.</line>

<line>That's the Science Club g*ng.</line>

<line>That Arnold was a cut-up.
- Yeah?</line>

<line>Leader of the pack, you know?</line>

<line>Drove the Sisters barking mad.</line>

<line>We'll make a posse.</line>

<line>Find that old girl and
bring her on in.</line>

<line>I got the rope.</line>

<line>Freddy, got your spurs on?
- Got'em, Sheriff.</line>

<line>What do you think you're doing?</line>

<line>We're going to the woods.</line>

<line>Bedtime was an hour ago.</line>

<line>We're gonna lasso a cow,
Sister Vivian.</line>

<line>There are no cows in the woods.
- That's what you think.</line>

<line>Yeah, he was kind of the
holy terror of Fernwood,</line>

<line>so, of course, uh, well,
we all loved him.</line>

<line>Why are you asking about him?</line>

<line>We're working a homicide from .</line>

<line>We think the victim
was probably Arnold.</line>

<line>Oh, no.</line>

<line>Could you look at a picture for us?</line>

<line>Do you think that might be Arnold?</line>

<line>Arnold had blonde hair... curls.</line>

<line>And if his hair was cut off?</line>

<line>I couldn't say yes but...
I couldn't say no.</line>

<line>I got two boys.
Adopted.</line>

<line>Hey. Anything off that suitcase?</line>

<line>Just that it was bought
at Wannamaker's in ' .</line>

<line>Only the biggest department
store in the city.</line>

<line>That was before credit cards,
so no records.</line>

<line>No prints on it either.</line>

<line>We got the okay from the orphan's
court to exhume the boy.</line>

<line>Is his sister gonna give us a swab?</line>

<line>She's pretty committed to this
boy not being Arnold, boss.</line>

<line>She better get uncommitted.</line>

<line>Blonde curls or not,
that's the same kid.</line>

<line>Find any of the other
boys in the photo?</line>

<line>Two others are dead besides Arnold.</line>

<line>One we just talked to.
- Yeah.</line>

<line>Says Arnold was a problem child.</line>

<line>If two different families took him in,</line>

<line>then changed their mind,
he must have been.</line>

<line>So Lila and Rubin bring him home,
he throws a fit right off.</line>

<line>Rubin gives him a paddling or
shakes him too hard, he ends up dead.</line>

<line>Well, what else do you do with a dead
kid besides dump him in a field?</line>

<line>Maybe there's a reason
they're hard to trace.</line>

<line>You can't find them?</line>

<line>No record of them anywhere
in Pennsylvenia.</line>

<line>We're trying the national database now.</line>

<line>Nut job.
O'clock.</line>

<line>Must be our rabbit guy.</line>

<line>Good luck.</line>

<line>Detectives Rush and Valens.</line>

<line>Walter Rafferty. I was the
one to find that boy in the box.</line>

<line>Thanks for coming in.</line>

<line>You have something new on the case?</line>

<line>Possibly.</line>

<line>He was about six years old.</line>

<line>Wrapped in a blue blanket.</line>

<line>It was : noon on Sunday,</line>

<line>and I followed a
jackrabbit into the brush</line>

<line>and I came upon a box,</line>

<line>a-a-a Liho Punch box,</line>

<line>and there was the boy.</line>

<line>Inside.</line>

<line>You didn't recognize him?</line>

<line>No. Absolutely not.</line>

<line>You weren't involved with him dying?</line>

<line>Absolutely not.
I took a polygraph test in .</line>

<line>We know you did.</line>

<line>I'll take one right now.</line>

<line>I gave the cops a straight story.</line>

<line>You do any investigating yourself?</line>

<line>As a matter of fact, I go back
to the site every year on April</line>

<line>and I'm not the only one.</line>

<line>There's a woman who
goes out there, too.</line>

<line>I...I seen her there for years.</line>

<line>Yeah. We've got that down here.</line>

<line>She comes with white roses,
wearing a green plaid coat.</line>

<line>You ever talk to this woman?</line>

<line>I tried a few times.</line>

<line>She didn't want to engage.</line>

<line>Why is this whole Boy in the Box
thing so big in your life, Walter?</line>

<line>I guess you've seen
lots of dead bodies.</line>

<line>Doesn't bother you?</line>

<line>Well, I'm not built that way.</line>

<line>This... this derailed me.</line>

<line>I wish I never saw that rabbit.</line>

<line>I think this Walter guy's
on the level, boss.</line>

<line>Just gotten messed up
by finding the body.</line>

<line>What do you think of his story
about the lady in the plaid coat?</line>

- .

<line>Even if it's true, what's it mean?</line>

<line>She could just be
an obssessive like him.</line>

<line>How long you think this'll take?</line>

<line>One of your girls waiting for you?</line>

<line>What I wouldn't give to take a
look at Scotty's black book?</line>

<line>You know what? Forget it.
I can go tomorrow.</line>

<line>Didn't want to miss the show, huh?</line>

<line>We finally found records
on Rubin and Lila Hanson.</line>

<line>And?</line>

<line>Well, there's a reason
they were so hard to find.</line>

<line>They died in the .</line>

<line>Arnold's parents don't exist.</line>

<line>Rubin and Lila Hanson died
before the trun of the century.</line>

<line>Buried at the cemetery
at St. Emilian's.</line>

<line>The same church where
the suitcase turned up.</line>

<line>So the adoption papers are phony.</line>

<line>So what happened to Arnold the
night he was supposedly adopted?</line>

<line>Maybe he died in the orphanage.</line>

<line>Someone on the inside covered
it up with adoption records.</line>

<line>Here's another layer.</line>

<line>Autopsy of our boy positively
I.D.'d him as Arnold Culliver</line>

<line>from dental records, but, uh...</line>

<line>Arnold's DNA...</line>

<line>doesn't match Gretchen's.</line>

<line>So they're not brother and sister?</line>

<line>Then Arnold's intake papers
were doctored, too.</line>

<line>So this kid came from
nowhere and went nowhere.</line>

<line>Who signed these records?</line>

<line>Sister Vivian.</line>

<line>And guess who's not talking now?</line>

<line>Sister Vivian.</line>

<line>In seclusion.</line>

<line>Nun on the run.</line>

<line>Ever staked out a convent?</line>

<line>I'll go anywhere.</line>

<line>Gretchen's gonna take this hard.
- Yeah.</line>

<line>How do we tell her that not only
did her brother die years ago,</line>

<line>but on top of that, he wasn't
actually her brother.</line>

<line>This must be a mistake.</line>

<line>No. No, I'm sorry.</line>

<line>Arnold and I came to
Fernwood together.</line>

<line>Our parents were k*lled
in a train wreck.</line>

<line>You didn't have the
same parents, Gretchen.</line>

<line>Sisters Vivian and Grace
knew about this?</line>

<line>I think they must have.</line>

<line>And they kept it a secret
from me all this time?</line>

<line>You were young.</line>

<line>Maybe they were protecting you.</line>

<line>Gretchen, we know now that
Arnold was never adopted.</line>

<line>There was no family that
came and took him away.</line>

<line>And right around that time,</line>

<line>someone hurt him,
bad enough it k*lled him.</line>

<line>The best explanation right now
is that he died at Fernwood.</line>

<line>We need your help thinking about
who could have hurt him.</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>Was anyone ever violent with Arnold?</line>

<line>Freddy Baker.</line>

<line>He's in that picture you have.</line>

<line>He beat Arnold up pretty bad once.</line>

<line>Who else?</line>

<line>Arnold got disciplined a lot.</line>

<line>By who?</line>

<line>Sister Vivian.</line>

<line>Why are you back?</line>

<line>I didn't like that family
and they didn't like me.</line>

<line>They kick you out?</line>

<line>I ran. There was no one to play with.</line>

<line>Well, Arnold, what do you
have to say for yourself?</line>

<line>Good to be home.</line>

<line>You're pleased with
yourself, are you?</line>

<line>Didn't hurt.</line>

<line>Arnold's coming to my office.</line>

<line>Don't, Sister Vivian.</line>

<line>I never knew what she did
to him in her office,</line>

<line>but he came out with
a lot of bruises.</line>

<line>Would Sister Grace punish him too?</line>

<line>It was always Sister Vivian.</line>

<line>You ask Freddy Baker.
He ended up in her office a lot, too.</line>

<line>Fernwood, ahhh.</line>

<line>Bad memories?</line>

<line>The worst.</line>

<line>Sorry to bring it up,
but it's a homicide investigation.</line>

<line>Who died?</line>

<line>Boy named Arnold Culliver.</line>

<line>Arnold?</line>

<line>Crap.</line>

<line>That's one of the few kids I liked.</line>

<line>The way I hear it, Fred,</line>

you were kind of a
<line>bully at Fernwood.</line>

<line>Yeah, I'd run around dropping
guys for looking at me funny.</line>

<line>Real nice kid, you know?</line>

<line>You ever drop Arnold?</line>

<line>One time.</line>

<line>But mostly I just left him alone
'cause he had spirit, you know?</line>

<line>Gave the nuns hell.</line>

<line>He was popular, huh?</line>

<line>With the kids, yeah.</line>

<line>Funny thing about him,
he loved it at Fernwood.</line>

<line>Everyone else wanted to get out,
he kept coming back.</line>

<line>What are your memories
of Sister Vivian?</line>

<line>Mean old battle-ax.</line>

<line>She's the reason I kept my
kids out of Catholic school.</line>

<line>She ever whale on you
enough to do damage?</line>

<line>Sure.</line>

<line>She was sadistic.</line>

<line>So you think she could have hurt
Arnold bad enough to k*ll him?</line>

<line>Are you saying Arnold
died at Fernwood?</line>

<line>We don't know yet.</line>

<line>I thought he got adopted.
- No.</line>

<line>Sister Vivian was pretty cruel.</line>

<line>But m*rder?</line>

<line>It might have been accidental.</line>

<line>I'll tell you it got pretty bad.</line>

<line>I still got scars on my back
from where she took the belt to me.</line>

<line>She used a belt, huh?</line>

<line>With me.</line>

<line>She mixed it up.</line>

<line>Spoons, paddles.</line>

<line>Had a lot of tricks in her bag.</line>

<line>I'm sorry as hell that kid died.</line>

<line>Sister Vivian.</line>

<line>You're a hard lady to get to.</line>

<line>I'm in seclusion.
- It'll only take a few minutes.</line>

<line>I'm not comfortable with this.</line>

<line>You know, I'm not comfortable
with a few things myself.</line>

<line>Like Arnold's phony intake papers
and his phony adoption records.</line>

<line>I don't know anything about that.</line>

<line>And the fact that his supposed
parents died in the s.</line>

<line>I'm also uncomfortable with what I'm
hearing about the corporal punishment</line>

<line>you gave out at Fernwood.</line>

<line>Raising Children calls for discipline.</line>

<line>Oh, you were extra rough
with Arnold Culliver.</line>

<line>He had a serious behavior problem.</line>

<line>Oh, now you remember him?</line>

<line>Because before, you
couldn't place him at all.</line>

<line>Yes, I remember Arnold.</line>

<line>He was a troubled boy.</line>

<line>And you just didn't feel like telling
me and my partner that before?</line>

<line>We lead private lives here,
and I believe in discretion.</line>

<line>I don't like prying eyes.</line>

<line>Because they might
discover what you did.</line>

<line>I didn't do anything out of
the ordinary to those children.</line>

<line>You left kids with lifelong scars.</line>

<line>Maybe it sounds scandalous today,</line>

<line>but it was routine in .</line>

<line>Mm. So maybe in a routine
pummeling of Arnold one night,</line>

<line>he fell unconscious
from one of your blows.</line>

<line>Died, in fact.</line>

<line>You'd want to be discreet
about that event,</line>

<line>so maybe you cut off
those blonde curls</line>

<line>so no one recognized him,
put him in a box,</line>

<line>and privately took him to a field
and dumped him.</line>

<line>That's a remarkable thing
to say to a woman of God.</line>

<line>Is it true?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Why did you fake Arnold's intake
and adoption records?</line>

<line>I didn't.</line>

<line>Your signature's on
both sets of papers.</line>

<line>Sister Grace did the paperwork</line>

<line>and I, as the senior sister at Fernwood,
signed the documents.</line>

<line>Was Sister Grace as fond of
corporal punishment as you are?</line>

<line>I won't speak ill of the dead.
- Why did she fake the records?</line>

<line>Why did she do any of the
stupid things that she did?</line>

<line>Sister Grace was a screwup.</line>

<line>She was weak-willed,
and she was unreliable</line>

<line>and she couldn't
discipline the children,</line>

<line>and that's why I had to.</line>

<line>What's your name?</line>

<line>He's Arnold.</line>

<line>Do you like swimming, Arnold?</line>

<line>I like horses.</line>

<line>Afraid we don't have any of those,</line>

but we do have a membership
<line>at the Haverford swimming pool.</line>

<line>Does that sound like fun?</line>

<line>Pow, pow, pow, pow!</line>

<line>Don't socialize with
the parents so much.</line>

<line>I'm sorry.</line>

<line>Arnold just shoved a woman.</line>

<line>I told him, best behavior.</line>

<line>We have to control him, Grace.</line>

<line>He'll never get a home if we don't.</line>

<line>Could Grace have hurt Arnold?</line>

<line>Grace...</line>

<line>Some stories shouldn't be told.</line>

<line>Vivian claimed Grace was
the one to doctor the records.</line>

<line>Is she offering a reason why?</line>

<line>She was mysterious about her.</line>

<line>And conveniently, Grace is dead.</line>

<line>How'd it go with Fred the bully?</line>

<line>He's a decent guy.</line>

<line>Adopted twins from Romania.</line>

<line>Did he do in Arnold?</line>

<line>Nah, but he confirmed
Sister Vivian was good and vicious.</line>

<line>Found the last kid in the
photo, it's Paul Evans.</line>

<line>He add anything to the picture?</line>

<line>More of the same.</line>

<line>Loved Arnold,
terrified of Sister Vivian.</line>

<line>One thing struck us, though.</line>

<line>He said he couldn't have kids.</line>

<line>Yeah. First guy we found, Roger...</line>

<line>he adopted his kids.</line>

<line>Fred adopted, too.</line>

<line>That's what we mean.</line>

<line>Three out of the six boys on that photo
don't or can't have kids.</line>

<line>Maybe orphans are more likely
to adopt when they grow up.</line>

<line>Three out of six, Lil?</line>

<line>That's a cluster,
not a coincidence.</line>

<line>Gretchen said this is a picture
of the Science Club boys, right?</line>

<line>Right.</line>

<line>Maybe we need to find out
what they did at this club.</line>

<line>Uh, the boys went to
the Science Club on Fridays,</line>

<line>while the rest of us had music class.</line>

<line>Science Club wasn't at Fernwood?</line>

<line>No, they went someplace else.
So, took that bus.</line>

<line>By themselves?
- Sister Grace went with them.</line>

<line>You know what they did there?</line>

<line>No. It was only for boys.</line>

<line>And you don't know where it was.</line>

<line>No, but I think that picture you have</line>

<line>was taken wherever the club was held.</line>

<line>Was it?</line>

<line>That building's not Fernwood.</line>

<line>Maybe we blow this up?</line>



<line>Science Club was, um,
just a weekly field trip.</line>

<line>To where?</line>

<line>A hospital-type building.</line>

<line>What kind of things did you do there?</line>

<line>It was different every time.</line>

<line>Could you give us a for instance?</line>

<line>One time we had a breakfast
in the afternoon.</line>

<line>Hello, Doctor.
- Sister Grace.</line>

<line>Hello, boys.</line>

<line>Do we have to give
blood today, Dr. Thayer?</line>

<line>No. Today all you have
to do is eat cornflakes.</line>

<line>We just had lunch!</line>

<line>I hope you're hungry.</line>

<line>It was fun.</line>

<line>Nothing scary about it.</line>

<line>Do you know Dr. Thayer's first name?</line>

<line>Nah, sorry.</line>

<line>Roger, we have to ask you
a personal question. / Okay.</line>

<line>Did you adopt kids because
you couldn't have your own?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>That was your side,</line>

<line>not your wife's.</line>

<line>How'd you know that?</line>

<line>All three men still alive from
Science Club confirmed as sterile.</line>

<line>How you gonna blame that on cornflakes?</line>

<line>I don't know</line>

<line>and I don't know what it's got to do
with Arnold's head wounds, either.</line>

<line>We gotta find out what else was
going on in this place, Lil.</line>

<line>Got a partial name on the building.</line>

<line>Uh, H-O-something-I-N-something.</line>

<line>Something... Institute?</line>

<line>Hoover Institute, in Fairmount.</line>

<line>So let's look for anyone
who worked there in '</line>

<line>starting with Dr. Thayer.</line>

<line>Uh...</line>

<line>I got some, Lil.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>You know what, I can go tomorrow.</line>

<line>You've been saying that all
week, Scotty, but you never go.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>I'll meet you in
the morning, Scotty.</line>

<line>First thing?</line>

<line>First thing.</line>

<line>All right, you want me
to auto-track Thayer?</line>

<line>Uh, maybe let me, boss.</line>

<line>No, I got to learn how to run
this computer sometime, Lil.</line>

<line>Is it on?</line>

<line>Sorry I'm late.</line>

<line>The bus was parked right over there.</line>

<line>We know what was going
on here in the ' s?</line>

<line>Government research.</line>

<line>Dr. Milton Thayer
was using volunteers</line>

<line>including the boys from Fernwood</line>

<line>as test groups.</line>

<line>What was Fernwood getting in return?</line>

<line>They were paid a fee
for every boy they brought over.</line>

<line>I got the contracts.</line>

<line>Sister Vivian set this up?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Sister Grace.</line>

<line>What kind of tests are we talking?</line>

<line>That's what we got to ask Dr. Thayer.</line>

<line>He's an emeritus researcher here.</line>

<line>Yeah, I remember the Fernwood boys.</line>

<line>They were subjects in a series
of radiation tests for us.</line>

<line>Radiation.
- Right.</line>

<line>We heard something about cornflakes.</line>

<line>That was one of the methods.</line>

<line>How'd that work?</line>

<line>The milk was irradiated.</line>

<line>You gave radioactive milk
to six-year-old boys?</line>

<line>Very low levels.</line>

<line>We also put it in the toothphaste and
had them brush their teeth with it.</line>

<line>This was government-sponsored?</line>

<line>You're what, years old?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>So you don't remember the Cold w*r.</line>

<line>What about it?</line>

<line>We lived in fear of the b*mb.</line>

<line>Radiation research was
considered necessary.</line>

<line>It was even patriotic.</line>

<line>Did you know your tests
left three men sterile?</line>

<line>We didn't intend to harm anyone,</line>

<line>but at the time, we were
working for a cause.</line>

<line>So you don't regret the tests?</line>

<line>We worked within the boundaries
of what we knew.</line>

<line>Back in the ' 's, we thought
those tests would do us good.</line>

<line>We also performed lobotomies,
which we now think are barbaric,</line>

<line>but at the time, it was considered
cutting-edge medicine.</line>

<line>Uh-huh.</line>

<line>Can't help the times you live in.</line>

<line>So Sister Grace arranged
the visits to the Institute.</line>

<line>Think she knew what she
was doing to these kids?</line>

<line>She was a nun, not a doctor.</line>

<line>And back in ' ,</line>

<line>the culture was,
doctor could do no wrong.</line>

<line>You didn't question them.</line>

<line>You didn't question
the government, either.</line>

<line>They funded the tests.</line>

<line>Been looking into
what else was going on</line>

<line>at the Hoover Institute in ' .</line>

<line>A lot of behavioral research.</line>

<line>What's that mean?</line>

<line>Trying to straighten out psychotics</line>

<line>by way of insulin treatments,
isolation tanks, electroshock.</line>

<line>Oh, God.</line>

<line>Tell me they didn't test
that on the orphans.</line>

<line>That would explain
Arnold's head wounds.</line>

<line>I auto-tracked an ancient nurse,
used to work in Behavior.</line>

<line>Still in Philly?</line>

<line>Sally Thurber, old lady now,</line>

<line>kicking it in a retirement community.</line>

<line>I remember that Boy in the Box case.</line>

<line>I never put it together
with Fernwood.</line>

<line>No one did.</line>

<line>Those boys were darlings.</line>

<line>Did you know any of them?
Maybe they were research subjects?</line>

<line>Oh, not for us. No.</line>

<line>I just saw them around the Institute
in their...little gray uniforms.</line>

<line>I'd talk to the nun
who brought them sometimes.</line>

<line>Sister Grace?</line>

<line>She'd come down to
Behavior once in a while.</line>

<line>Yeah? Why would she do that?</line>

<line>Well...</line>

<line>I suppose everyone's dead now,</line>

<line>so I can speak out of school.</line>

<line>Please.</line>

<line>She'd come visit Clayton...</line>

<line>an assistant in our lab,</line>

<line>a medical student,</line>

<line>and they were friendly.</line>

<line>Friendly how?</line>

<line>Well, more friendly than a nun should
be with a young man, in my opinion.</line>

<line>He's a good boy at heart,
but he acts up.</line>

<line>You look beautiful, Grace. /Shh.</line>

<line>I can't tell you that?
- Clay, he needs a family.</line>

<line>I'm worried he won't get
one if he doesn't change.</line>

<line>He'll outgrow it.</line>

<line>No. It's getting worse.</line>

<line>Please help him.</line>

<line>I don't know what you want me to do.</line>

<line>The treatment you give
the patients here...</line>

<line>That's not for children.
- Does it work?</line>

<line>It's very effective.</line>

<line>Calms them down, right?</line>

<line>Right.</line>

<line>I know it could help him.</line>

<line>Grace...</line>

<line>There's an adoption party tomorrow.</line>

<line>Please. For me, Clay?</line>

<line>Did you ever see the boy
they were talking about?</line>

<line>That same night -- I was leaving,</line>

<line>I saw Grace again with
that little boy in tow.</line>

<line>Where were they going?</line>

<line>I assumed to see Clayton,
to get that treatment she asked for.</line>

<line>What was that treatment?</line>

<line>ECT.</line>

<line>Shock treatment.</line>

<line>I remember that night,
because that's the only time</line>

<line>I ever saw Grace out of her habit.</line>

<line>I never even knew
she had blonde hair.</line>

<line>What was she wearing that night?</line>

<line>A plaid coat.</line>

<line>A green plaid coat.</line>

<line>Sounds like Sister Grace and Clayton
were some kind of item.</line>

<line>And he knew how to administer ECT,</line>

<line>which was supposed to
control wild behavior.</line>

<line>And she wanted a boy controlled
for an adoption party.</line>

<line>There was a party
at Fernwood on April .</line>

<line>The day before Arnold was found.</line>

<line>So maybe on April ,</line>

<line>Grace and Arnold secretely
come to the Institute.</line>

<line>She's wearing lay clothes
so no one recognizes her...</line>

<line>Except for Sally the busybody.</line>

<line>She's in a green plaid coat,</line>

<line>just like the woman our Rabbit Guy
saw in that field over the years.</line>

<line>Probably Grace.</line>

<line>And before you give shock treatment,
you cut off the patient's hair.</line>

<line>Grace had the same coat,
all those years?</line>

<line>How many coats does a nun have?</line>

<line>Why does she go to such
lengths for this kid</line>

<line>when she's got kids who need help?</line>

<line>Yeah. Why Arnold?</line>

<line>Sally makes it sounds like
Grace and Clayton had a relationship.</line>

<line>Yeah?</line>

<line>We still don't know who
Arnold's parents were.</line>

<line>And why Grace doctored
those intake records.</line>

<line>That's sacrilegious.</line>

<line>Lil, she was a nun.</line>

<line>She was also human.</line>

<line>We can talk here.</line>

<line>You probably don't want the sisters
overhearing this conversation.</line>

<line>What is it now?</line>

<line>We think we know who
Arnold's mother was.</line>

<line>I didn't want to tell
the story of Grace.</line>

<line>I know you didn't.</line>

<line>But a little boy died, Vivian.</line>

<line>Her little boy.</line>

<line>Grace was... not a good nun.</line>

<line>No kidding.</line>

<line>She was dreamy. Weak.</line>

<line>She had good intentions,</line>

<line>she just didn't have self-control.</line>

<line>Do you know Clayton Waters?</line>

<line>He was Grace's ruin.</line>

<line>She was in love with him?</line>

<line>Till the day she died.</line>

<line>When she was ,
she came to me</line>

<line>and told me she was pregnant.</line>

<line>I probably should have
just told Mother Superior,</line>

<line>but instead, I helped her go
away for a few months.</line>

<line>You and Grace were close?</line>

<line>Like blood sisters.</line>

<line>She promised to leave the baby
at a Pittsburgh orphanage.</line>

<line>But she just couldn't,
and so she brought him back to Fernwood.</line>

<line>And slipped him in
as Gretchen's brother.</line>

<line>He became our cross to bear.</line>

<line>Misbehaving all the time.</line>

<line>Couldn't hold on to a family.</line>

<line>And he was getting older,
less adoptable.</line>

<line>Did he know Grace was his mother?</line>

<line>We never told him...</line>

<line>but I think a part of him knew
that he was home with Grace.</line>

<line>That's why he kept coming back.</line>

<line>So what happened to
Arnold on April ?</line>

<line>Oh, April ... well...</line>

<line>On April , Grace was
desperate to find him a home.</line>

<line>Right.</line>

<line>Before I tell you the rest,</line>

<line>I want you to know that
everything Grace did,</line>

<line>she did because she loved him.</line>

<line>Vivian. Vivian!</line>

<line>What are you wearing?</line>

<line>Arnold's sick.</line>

<line>What in the world happened?</line>

<line>Clayton treated him.
To help him behave.</line>

<line>You're not supposed to see Clayton.</line>

<line>We had to cut his hair off,</line>

<line>his beautiful hair...</line>

<line>Did Clayton say he'd
be sick like this?</line>

<line>He said he might feel tired, but...
Vivian, he's got such a fever.</line>

<line>We have to pray for him.</line>

<line>I thought it would help.</line>

<line>He'd behave, and then some couple
would want him, and keep him.</line>

<line>Say a prayer, Grace.</line>

<line>It was supposed to calm him,</line>

<line>to control him.</line>

<line>Grace never dreamt
it would be harmful.</line>

<line>Did Arnold make it to
the adoption party?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>No, his fever got worse.</line>

<line>We're out of punch, Sister Vivian.</line>

<line>Mm.. th-there's a new
box in the kitchen.</line>

<line>Where's Arnold?</line>

<line>He'll be down soon.</line>

<line>Go talk to people.</line>

<line>He's going, Vivian.</line>

<line>I'll... meet you...</line>

<line>Oh, Arnold...</line>

<line>I hope you know I loved you.</line>

<line>... I'll meet you at the horses.</line>

<line>What are you doing?</line>

<line>Clean the room up.</line>

<line>I wanna come.
- Grace!</line>

<line>This is not one of
your little screwups.</line>

<line>This is very serious.</line>

<line>I'm coming, too.</line>
