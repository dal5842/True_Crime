<xml><line>Get her in the back.</line>

<line>What... what do I...?
- Follow directions.</line>

<line>Okay, let me get out first.</line>

<line>The guys were digging up the
foundation of the old Calvin building.</line>

<line>They made the discovery this morning.</line>

<line>Two bags of bones.</line>

<line>In the cement?
- No, underneath.</line>

<line>So they got thrown in here when they
were first putting up the building?</line>

<line>Yeah, the doer figured
they were buried forever,</line>

<line>and now the city wants a parking lot.</line>

<line>The remains are mostly skeletal,</line>

<line>but they were buried in plastic, so,
uh, a lot of the clothes survived.</line>

<line>One male... one female.</line>

<line>How can you tell that?</line>

<line>Pelvic bones. Shoe size.</line>

<line>When did bell bottoms
come back in style,</line>

<line>five years ago?</line>

<line>Don't look at me.</line>

<line>They've been down here
more than five years.</line>

<line>This building's at least years old.</line>

<line>So they're from the original
days of bell bottoms.</line>

<line>The ' 's.</line>

<line>Those pants were ugly
the first time around.</line>

<line>Look at that.</line>

<line>Summer of love.</line>

<line>Where did it all go wrong?</line>

<line>. You weren't even
born yet, right?</line>

<line>World had to wait till the ' s for me.</line>

<line>You know how many words
there are for narcissist?</line>

<line>Scotty.</line>

<line>Hey. You okay?</line>

<line>Yeah. You just forgot to fill
this out before you left.</line>

<line>I'll see you upstairs.</line>

<line>Hi... uh, I'm Elisa.</line>

<line>Lilly. / Hi.</line>

<line>My partner.</line>

<line>You're a detective?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>You're so beautiful.</line>

<line>Thanks.</line>

<line>See you up there.</line>

<line>Sorry.</line>

<line>Did I embarrass you? / No.</line>

<line>You never told me
your partner was a girl.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>We... okay today?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>It's a good day, I think.</line>

<line>Quiet.</line>

<line>No box on these two jobs.</line>

<line>Had to go to Missing Persons.</line>

<line>A white woman and black man
disappeared together June , .</line>

<line>Missing persons didn't
knock themselves out.</line>

<line>If you're over and of sound mind,
you're allowed to disappeared.</line>

<line>And the lifesyle.</line>

<line>A lot of people disappeared
in the ' s.</line>

<line>Some of 'em don't even know it.</line>

<line>The woman was Julia Hoffman, ,</line>

<line>reported missing by her
parents, now deceased.</line>

<line>Lived in a commune.</line>

<line>Disappeared with Gerard Gary, .</line>

<line>Looks like Julia's station
wagon disappeared, too.</line>

<line>We ran an NCIC search,</line>

<line>see if the car ever turned
up anywhere, but no luck.</line>

<line>These bodies were dumped professional
style in that construction site.</line>

<line>Which says organized crime.</line>

<line>So how does that intersect
with hippies?</line>

<line>dr*gs?</line>

<line>Had to buy them somewhere.</line>

<line>Maybe the black-white
thing bothered somebody.</line>

<line>You got any family contacts
on either of them?</line>

<line>No, but we have a name
on a boyfriend for Julia.</line>

<line>Another commune member.</line>

<line>You mean the guy she was
found with wasn't her boyfriend?</line>

<line>If he was, she had one at home, too.</line>

<line>Not a bad motive for
boyfriend Number One,</line>

<line>there being a Number two.</line>

<line>Let's go see this commune guy.</line>

<line>Adam Clarke, where are you now?</line>

<line>Life coach.</line>

<line>You get to choose...</line>

<line>how to view your experience.</line>

<line>What's the empowering choice?</line>

<line>Taking responsibility.</line>

<line>Winners take responsibility, all right?</line>

<line>All right. See everyone tomorrow.</line>

<line>Thanks.</line>

<line>Adam Clarke?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Detective Rush and Valens, Homicide.</line>

<line>That's a room-emptier.</line>

<line>We're here about Julia Hoffman.</line>

<line>You were dating her in ?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Till she disappeared on me.</line>

<line>Her remains have been found.</line>

<line>Along with the remains of Gerard Gary.</line>

<line>You mind?</line>

<line>They're herbal.</line>

<line>I thought Julia went to Canada
with that Gerard guy.</line>

<line>Looks like they never
made it out of the city.</line>

<line>Ugly.</line>

<line>What kind of relationship
did you two have?</line>

<line>Six months of hot and
heavy in the commune.</line>

<line>Serious?</line>

<line>No. I was more serious
about ending the w*r.</line>

<line>So her being with this other
guy didn't rile you at all.</line>

<line>We had an open relationship.</line>

<line>It was the ' s.</line>

<line>It was part of the revolution--</line>

<line>change the world,
change ourselves.</line>

<line>But human nature doesn't always
conform to revolutionary ideals.</line>

<line>Well, that's why I do this work.</line>

<line>And that's being a life coach,
I take it.</line>

<line>It's easy to make fun of.</line>

<line>We have a saying:</line>

"<line>Being cynical's the booby prize."</line>

<line>Any idea if Julia and Gerard
were dealing dr*gs?</line>

<line>No chance.</line>

<line>Aw, come on, Adam -- summer of ' .</line>

<line>Oh, we took dr*gs,
for sure, but... dealing?</line>

<line>We just weren't that organized.</line>

<line>The last time you saw Julia, did
you fight, and part on bad terms?</line>

<line>Furthest thing from it.</line>

<line>It's time.</line>

<line>Our soldiers are coming
home in body bags!</line>

<line>The Vietnamese people die and die!</line>

<line>Now, there comes a time when you
have to throw yourself into history,</line>

<line>not stand on the sidelines.</line>

<line>My draft card!</line>

<line>You let'em arrest me!</line>

<line>I'm saying no!</line>

<line>I'm saying hell, no!</line>

<line>I... won't... go!</line>

<line>Hell, no, we won't go!</line>

<line>Hell, no, we won't go!</line>

<line>Hell, no, we won't go!</line>

<line>Hell, no, we won't go!</line>

<line>Hell, no, we won't go!</line>

<line>Hell, no, we won't go!</line>

<line>Hell, no, we won't go!</line>

<line>Glory days, huh?</line>

<line>Intense...
as we used to say.</line>

<line>And Julia and Gerard being together,</line>

<line>that didn't bring up any intense
feelings, like jealousy?</line>

<line>It hurt, some.</line>

<line>But that was our deal.</line>

<line>Who was the girl with Julia?</line>

<line>Her friend Terri.</line>

<line>She lived with us for awhile.</line>

<line>Remember her last name?</line>

<line>Maxwell.</line>

<line>A rich Cherry Hill girl who came and
played hippie for a couple of years.</line>

<line>Now she's a rich art dealer.</line>

<line>Julia and I were on dishes
duty at the commune.</line>

<line>The men were totally into equality
until we ran out of clean plates.</line>

<line>So you knew Adam Clarke?</line>

<line>Of course! He was the
king of the commune.</line>

<line>Well, he claims he didn't mind
Julia being with Gerard.</line>

<line>You believe that?</line>

<line>I do, actually.</line>

<line>Only because he was
so... self-absorbed.</line>

<line>How so?</line>

<line>He was the star of the
anti-w*r movement.</line>

<line>And he was inspiring, I admit.</line>

<line>But he was an a*s.</line>

<line>He thought of himself as
a babe magnet, ' s-style.</line>

<line>Well, even babe magnets
don't like being dumped.</line>

<line>Especially babe magnets.</line>

<line>I just don't think he cared
enough about Julia to harm her.</line>

<line>Right.</line>

<line>There is something I didn't
tell the police in ' .</line>

<line>In my world, back then...</line>

<line>you just didn't tell the
cops a lot of things.</line>

<line>Oink, oink?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>What didn't you tell?</line>

<line>Julia and Gerard were into
something... clandestine.</line>

<line>Like what?</line>

<line>There were a lot of
secret phone calls...</line>

um, messages from someone
<line>who called himself Dr.L.</line>

<line>And Julia always had
these envelopes of cash.</line>

<line>And how do you know
Gerard was involved?</line>

<line>The night before they disappeared,</line>

<line>they were planning something.</line>

<line>Hell, no, we won't go!</line>

<line>Hell, no, we won't go!</line>

<line>The meeting place
doesn't work anymore.</line>

<line>I know.</line>

: <line>a.m. tomorrow,
we pick up on a new corner.</line>

<line>She'll have the bread?</line>

<line>Yep.</line>

<line>You scared?</line>

<line>No way, baby. You?</line>

<line>Hell, no, we won't go!</line>

<line>Does he know?</line>

<line>I'd never tell him.</line>

<line>Julia was your best friend, and
you didn't ask her what was up?</line>

<line>She didn't wanna tell me.</line>

<line>And to be honest,
I was scared to know.</line>

<line>I was a suburbs girl trying
out the commune life.</line>

<line>If it ever got too gritty,
I knew I could always go home.</line>

<line>But Julia, she was for real,</line>

<line>and she was into something... deep.</line>

<line>Forensics found a long
brown hair with the bodies</line>

<line>under a piece of tape
on the plastic.</line>

<line>Could be Julia's.</line>

<line>We'll catch a break if it's not.</line>

<line>Any leads on the missing car?</line>

<line>Mm. Sludge.</line>

<line>What about it?</line>

<line>Uh, it was smeared on
the plastic and the clothes,</line>

<line>and has caffeic acid
and pyrazine in it.</line>

<line>Chemicals made in
manufacturing coffee.</line>

<line>k*ller gave'em one last cappuccino?</line>

<line>Or they were wrapped
up near the waterfront</line>

<line>by the Bogata Coffee plant.</line>

<line>Was it there in ' ?</line>

<line>Established ' .</line>

<line>Smart, Nicky.</line>

<line>Gives a specific place to
dredge for a station wagon.</line>

<line>That enough to get the divers out?</line>

<line>I'll call the Marine Unit.</line>

<line>I was at Woodstock, you know.</line>

<line>You?</line>

<line>Jimi Hendrix. That cat could play.</line>

<line>Did he say "cat"?</line>

<line>You take your clothes off
and roll in the mud, boss?</line>

<line>Uh, set-up and security
for one of the vendors.</line>

<line>Which one?</line>

<line>Porta Potti.</line>

<line>Now I'm seeing it.</line>

<line>Let's take a look.</line>

<line>There's a real time capsule for you.</line>

<line>years as a fish motel.</line>

<line>What've you got there, Lil,
a dead fish?</line>

<line>Or a wallet.</line>

<line>I should be doing this in the lab.</line>

<line>I won't tell on you, Louie.</line>

<line>Want an Orange Crush?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>So, Elisa you actually
introduce people to.</line>

<line>Sets her apart.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>I'm sorry about that, uh, comment.</line>

<line>I don't mind getting
called beautiful.</line>

<line>Well, she's not a hundred
percent healthy.</line>

<line>Doctor calls it a...
a thinking disorder.</line>

<line>Sometimes she...</line>

<line>I think he's ready.</line>

<line>This pouch was inside the wallet.</line>

<line>And it seems to be airtight.</line>

<line>Like a ziplock?</line>

<line>Right.</line>

<line>So it protected whatever's inside.</line>

<line>Maybe.</line>

<line>What is it?</line>

<line>It's an address.</line>

<line>" Spruce Street. Jane."</line>

<line>West Philly.</line>

"<line>Do not give out address
except in emergency."</line>

<line>I'd call a double m*rder an emergency.</line>

<line>Detectives Rush and Valens.</line>

<line>We're looking for Jane.</line>

<line>You're here about Jane?</line>

<line>Yeah. Is she here?</line>

<line>Well, Jane's not a person.</line>

<line>Jane's an organization.</line>

<line>I'm Dr.Linden.</line>

<line>Dr.L.</line>

<line>Yeah. Please come in.</line>

<line>They were volunteers.</line>

<line>Then they stopped, suddenly.</line>

<line>What were they volunteers for?</line>

<line>Jane.</line>

<line>An ab*rtion service.</line>

<line>Underground.</line>

<line>In the ' s, ab*rtion was illegal.</line>

<line>Women still had them, of course.</line>

<line>Yeah. Coat hangers.</line>

<line>Knitting needles.</line>

<line>Ballpoint pens.</line>

<line>Jane's purpose was to
keep people away from</line>

<line>those dangerous procedures,</line>

<line>and provide them with safe ones.</line>

<line>And you were a provider?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Until ' , when the law changed.</line>

<line>What's with the name, "Jane"?</line>

<line>Security.</line>

<line>Everything had to be anonymous.</line>

<line>How'd that work?</line>

<line>Well, women would call
a number and ask for Jane.</line>

<line>The volunteers would call back,
set up an appointment.</line>

<line>That what Julia and Gerard did?</line>

<line>They escorted the patients,
handled the money,</line>

<line>they did everything.</line>

<line>When did you last see them?</line>

<line>In the morning, the day
they disappeared.</line>

<line>They brought over a young girl...</line>

<line>Sorry about the blindfold.</line>

<line>I wouldn't tell anything.</line>

<line>Especially if you don't
know where we are.</line>

<line>It's not dangerous.</line>

<line>It's gonna be okay.</line>

<line>What do I have to do?</line>

<line>The doctor will talk you through it.</line>

<line>He's a real doctor?</line>

<line>You'll get a D and C.</line>

<line>I don't know what that is.</line>

<line>Dilation and curettage.</line>

<line>It's the safest way.
Dr.L's real good.</line>

<line>He helped me.</line>

<line>Doctor, this is Renee.</line>

<line>How do you do?</line>

<line>Come with me now.</line>

<line>We'll get through this together.</line>

<line>The procedure went fine.</line>

<line>Julia and Gerard left with her...</line>

<line>and that's all I know.</line>

<line>You never got the girl's last name?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>I had to protect my medical license.</line>

<line>But Jane must've had her infomation,
in case something went wrong.</line>

<line>Probably.</line>

<line>But I only knew the contact people.</line>

<line>Did you get a new contact
after Julia and Gerard?</line>

<line>Colette Ferguson.</line>

<line>She's a poly sci professor at Temple.</line>

<line>I had an emergency number
and first name for that girl.</line>

<line>Renee.</line>

<line>No last name?</line>

<line>When Julia and Gerard went missing,
I called her, like it was routine.</line>

<line>She said everything was fine.</line>

<line>You save that number?</line>

<line>I did.</line>

<line>I don't know why.</line>

<line>Last link to Julia, probably.</line>

<line>I'd have to find it.</line>

<line>You were close to Julia?</line>

<line>We met under the worst of circumstances.</line>

<line>You okay?</line>

<line>He says I am.</line>

<line>Does he do it here?</line>

<line>The kitchen.</line>

<line>What's he use?</line>

<line>A bicycle spoke.</line>

<line>He says to keep it in
twenty... four hours...</line>

<line>then it happens.</line>

<line>He's supposed to be good.</line>

<line>You got the $ ?</line>

<line>I...</line>

<line>I-I have $ .</line>

<line>Okay, it's four.</line>

<line>I couldn't get more.</line>

<line>I'll get you some wine.
Calm you down.</line>

<line>He made me touch him before.</line>

<line>W-We should leave.</line>

<line>She took me home, checked
in on me the next day.</line>

<line>Which was lucky for me,
because I had an infection.</line>

<line>By the time she got me to the hospital...</line>

<line>Bad, huh?</line>

<line>Couldn't have children because of it.</line>

<line>So... how did Julia get to Dr.Linden?</line>

<line>She found an ad for Jane
in the Free Weekly.</line>

<line>She was so grateful after,
she went to work for Jane.</line>

<line>I did, too.</line>

<line>And she brought Gerard in?</line>

<line>No, he was already a volunteer.
That's how they met.</line>

<line>Why was he doing it? He know
someone who had one?</line>

<line>Most everyone does, son.</line>

<line>Sounds risky.</line>

<line>Especially for Gerard.</line>

<line>Why's that?</line>

<line>He was in the Black Liberation Front.</line>

<line>They were very militant,
and dead set against ab*rtion.</line>

<line>Considered it genocide for Black people.</line>

<line>Dead set as in m*rder?</line>

<line>His working for Jane was like a
declaration of w*r to some people.</line>

<line>Know anyone we can
talk to from the BLF?</line>

<line>Lionel Royce was the
leader the local chapter.</line>

<line>Where's Lionel now?</line>

<line>I hear he's in and out of prison.</line>

<line>Where he belongs, if he's
the one hurt those two.</line>

<line>We want to talk to you about
your old friend Gerard Gary.</line>

<line>Tragic man.</line>

<line>Limitless potential, unwise choices.</line>

<line>You didn't like some of his activities.</line>

<line>Helping black girls commit genocide?</line>

<line>No. I didn't like it.</line>

<line>But I'm a peaceful man.</line>

<line>So what's the r*fle about?</line>

<line>Remember George W. Bush in that
flight suit, landing on the aircraft carrier?</line>

<line>All about the image.</line>

<line>This... armed robbery beef
you're in for, that just image?</line>

<line>I was collecting reparations for sl*very.</line>

<line>From a -eleven?</line>

<line>Look, I had issues with Gerard.</line>

<line>However, if you're
suggesting I'd k*ll a brother?</line>

<line>We were way too busy getting
spied on, lied to, informed on,</line>

<line>and framed-up by the U.S.
Government to turn on each other.</line>

<line>You think you had an
informant in the BLF.</line>

<line>I know there were informants.</line>

<line>And maybe Gerard was one?</line>

<line>It's possible.</line>

<line>Way I see it, the White
man's got your mind,</line>

<line>and the White woman's
got your Jonhson.</line>

<line>She's a friend.</line>

<line>No, our friends don't come in that color.</line>

<line>What, you tellin' me who I can see?</line>

<line>We gotta be role models, brother Gerard.</line>

<line>Can't be running around with no
blue eye, blond hair Barbie doll.</line>

<line>Man, you gonna turn white yourself.</line>

<line>In case you haven't noticed,
the black don't rub off.</line>

<line>But this is serious, brother.</line>

<line>You know our secrets, man.</line>

<line>You pillow talk with that girl?</line>

<line>Huh?</line>

<line>You can't trust no white girl.</line>

<line>This ain't real to them.</line>

<line>They just playing a game.</line>

<line>This will never be real to them.</line>

<line>We got to have to dry clean
this place of yours, Gerard.</line>

<line>You think I'd betray you?</line>

<line>Standard operating procedure.</line>

<line>So the Black Liberation Front thought
Gerard was talking to the FBI.</line>

<line>Even if he was, we'd never
use a b*llet on a black man.</line>

<line>How'd you know it was a b*llet?</line>

<line>Just a metaphor, brother man.</line>

<line>Thanks for meeting me here.</line>

<line>My kids are home... you know.</line>

<line>Sure.</line>

<line>These people were good to me.</line>

<line>I feel like they saved my life.</line>

<line>You were ?</line>

<line>I didn't come from money,
and I wasn't smart.</line>

<line>I wasn't gonna go to college or
anything, but I wanted to get out.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Have a life that was bigger
than two square miles.</line>

<line>If I had a baby in high school...</line>

<line>Who knew about you being pregnant?</line>

<line>No one, for weeks.</line>

<line>And then I told my boyfriend.</line>

<line>He feel the same as you?</line>

<line>Wow.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>So we'll get married.</line>

<line>Charlie, I was thinking an ab*rtion.</line>

<line>That's illegal.</line>

<line>How do you even...?</line>

<line>I'm trying to find out.</line>

<line>Renee...</line>

<line>I applied Pan Am.</line>

<line>Stewardess training.</line>

<line>I did real good on the test.</line>

<line>Tell them something's come up.</line>

<line>Charlie, I want to go places...</line>

<line>London and stuff, you know?</line>

<line>We can go places together.</line>

<line>No, we can't.</line>

<line>If we have a baby... we'll
never even leave Fishtown.</line>

<line>You talk like your mind's made up.</line>

<line>I need money.</line>

<line>Screw you, Renee.</line>

<line>So you were on your own.</line>

<line>I asked around and finally
found a girl at school</line>

<line>whose cousin had a number for "Jane".</line>

<line>How'd you pay for it?</line>

<line>Sold a coat and my record player.</line>

<line>And Charlie?</line>

<line>I thought it was best if we
didn't have any contact.</line>

<line>But...?</line>

<line>Renee...</line>

<line>you said those people saved your life.</line>

<line>I thought I saw his truck.</line>

<line>That day?</line>

<line>Right before they picked me up.</line>

<line>I had no idea anything
happened to those people.</line>

<line>I wasn't upset about it.</line>

<line>That's not what Renee said.</line>

<line>She said you wanted to get married.</line>

<line>That's what you were supposed
to say if you got a girl in trouble.</line>

<line>So you didn't want to marry her?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Excuse me.</line>

<line>And you were for the ab*rtion?</line>

<line>I didn't want to get involved.</line>

<line>Then why were you at the meeting place
the day Renee went for the procedure?</line>

<line>She saw your truck, Charlie.</line>

<line>Look this is years later.</line>

<line>My wife... / No one's
talking to your wife.</line>

<line>I followed Renee.</line>

<line>Saw her meet those hippies.</line>

<line>And...?</line>

<line>I tailed the car to West Philly.</line>

<line>Where's Renee?</line>

<line>Be cool, man.</line>

<line>Shut that door.
- She in here?</line>

<line>No, no, this is a private home.
You can't just crash in here.</line>

<line>I'm gonna call the cops.</line>

<line>No, no you don't wanna do that.</line>



<line>But look at you, you're just a kid.</line>

<line>How old are you?</line>

<line>Seventeen.</line>

<line>You want a baby at ?</line>

<line>And a wife before your senior prom?</line>

<line>Look, how about some air, brother?</line>

<line>I cried on that hippie's
shoulder for ten minutes.</line>

<line>Then what?</line>

<line>Nothing.</line>

<line>Home.</line>

<line>Where were you two
hours later that day?</line>

<line>Home.</line>

<line>With anyone?</line>

<line>Yeah, my mom.
She's gone now.</line>

<line>That's too bad, Charlie.</line>

'<line>Cause those hippies
went missing that day.</line>

<line>Look, I didn't want Renee to do it.</line>

<line>But in retrospect, it was
the right thing for me.</line>

<line>Did you realize that
before or after they died?</line>

<line>Lil, Scotty, we got
the FBI file on Jane.</line>

<line>What, they had a file?</line>

<line>And they gave it up?</line>

<line>It's public record now.</line>

<line>We get names of informants?</line>

<line>No, they drew the line there,
but we did get these.</line>

<line>Yeah, surveillance photos
of the Jane volunteers.</line>

<line>Julia and Gerard, picking up
and dropping off women</line>

<line>April through June of ' .</line>

<line>This your young Renee?</line>

<line>That's her.</line>

<line>Then this was the day they disappeared.</line>

<line>Someone else was there.</line>

<line>Someone who took these photos
and gave them to the Feds.</line>

<line>An informant.</line>

<line>That nut case Lionel was right.</line>

<line>Lionel thought Gerard was a snitch.</line>

<line>Gerard didn't take these.</line>

<line>So who did?</line>

<line>Informants?</line>

<line>Sound off the wall?</line>

<line>Sounds dated.</line>

<line>Our case is dated.</line>

<line>There were always rumors like that.</line>

<line>Looks like a parlor game at the commune,</line>

<line>trying to decide who the snitch was.</line>

<line>Weird.</line>

<line>It was a paranoid time.</line>

<line>Well, it seems there was
someone watching Julia.</line>

<line>Then I guess it wasn't paranoia.</line>

<line>So in the parlor game,
who'd you suspect?</line>

<line>It wasn't a suspicion.</line>

<line>Intuition?</line>

<line>Adam and Julia were non-monogamous.</line>

<line>He told us.</line>

<line>And I...</line>

<line>Had first-hand knowledge of that?</line>

<line>Yes.</line>

<line>Granted, I was sort of
tripping at the time.</line>

<line>It's so fragile.</line>

<line>Can I take its picture?</line>

<line>These are great.</line>

<line>I'm documenting the movement.</line>

<line>Yeah?</line>

<line>I'm gonna do a book someday...</line>

<line>tell the story.</line>

<line>I love this one of Julia.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Have any of me?</line>

<line>I'll take some right now.</line>

<line>How about a rich Jersey girl
beds penniless draft dodger.</line>

<line>The camera was pretty
sophisticated for a guy like him.</line>

<line>It came into my mind for a
second, but I was so flattered</line>

that he considered me part of
<line>the movement I put it out again.</line>

<line>He ever put out that book?</line>

<line>Boss, we got some.</line>

<line>Yeah, us, too.</line>

<line>Adam Clarke, burning his draft card in ' .</line>

<line>He told us about that.</line>

<line>Problem is, Adam shouldn't
have had a draft card in ' .</line>

<line>We checked his military records.
He's already served.</line>

<line>Vietnam, ' to ' .</line>

<line>Really?</line>

<line>When Adam gets home,
it gets more interesting.</line>

<line>He crossed state lines driving
a "peace van" loaded with weed.</line>

<line>Arrested for drug sales.</line>

<line>Thought he was too
disorganized for that.</line>

<line>The case should have
bought him state time.</line>

<line>But then the feds took over
jurisdiction.</line>

<line>Poof. Case went away.</line>

<line>He made a deal with them.</line>

<line>Became a CI.</line>

"<line>Stay in the movement,
keep us informed."</line>

<line>Now those photos he had
of Julia really make sense.</line>

<line>Black and White, long lens.</line>

<line>Adam Clarke: ' s babe magnet,
star of the anti-w*r movement.</line>

<line>And FBI informant.</line>

<line>That'd be big news.</line>

<line>Big, bad news.</line>

<line>And if Julia found out?</line>

<line>There's your motive for m*rder.</line>

<line>Do you mind?</line>

<line>Not at all.</line>

<line>I know why you're here, Lilly.</line>

<line>Yeah?</line>

<line>I was an informant fot the FBI in .</line>

<line>Go on.</line>

<line>My old case agent called.
Give me a heads up.</line>

<line>Questions were being asked.</line>

<line>They didn't give us name. / I know.</line>

<line>And when you told me
about Julia and Gerard,</line>

<line>I... I hoped that my background
was irrelevant, but...</line>

<line>it may not be.</line>

<line>I was surveilling them
the day they disappeared.</line>

<line>June , :a.m.</line>

<line>Yeah. This guy's name is
Charlie Rinzler.</line>

<line>I-I know who he is.</line>

<line>Is-is that all you have of him?</line>

<line>Oh, he was so agitated,
I reported it to my case agent.</line>

<line>The Feds ran his license,
had me follow him for a week,</line>

<line>but nothing much came of it.</line>

<line>So, you have photos of Charlie from the
week after Julia and Gerard went missing?</line>

<line>Yeah, but nothing too exciting.</line>

<line>Can I see them anyway?</line>

<line>I basically followed him every
day for a week to and from work.</line>

<line>He was a day worker, in construction.</line>

<line>Can I take these?</line>

<line>They're yours...</line>

<line>if I can ask a favor.</line>

<line>If we can keep your secret, we will.</line>

<line>You worked construction back
in the s, huh, Charl?</line>

<line>Yeah, couple of summers.</line>

<line>Remember a job at the Calvin Building,</line>

<line>summer of ' ?</line>

<line>Putting down the foundation?</line>

<line>Maybe.</line>

'<line>Cause that just happens to be
where Julia and Gerard were dumped.</line>

<line>The same week you worked there.</line>

<line>It's an amazing coincidence.</line>

<line>Mm, too amazing.</line>

<line>That-that can't be right.</line>

<line>This is you at the
construction site, Charlie.</line>

<line>Who the hell took that?
- Good luck you had.</line>

<line>That foundation was being laid</line>

<line>just when you needed to
stash two dead hippies.</line>

<line>I never hurt them.</line>

<line>That guy was nice to me.</line>

<line>Long as that building was up,
you figured you were home free.</line>

<line>Too bad they want
a parking lot there now.</line>

<line>It's coincidence.</line>

<line>That's all.</line>

<line>I guess I need a lawyer.</line>

<line>Update for you.</line>

<line>Forensics is back on the
hair found with the bodies.</line>

<line>And?</line>

<line>It ain't Julia's.</line>

<line>So, there was someone else
at the scene with long, brown hair.</line>

<line>Charlie?</line>

<line>He was Nixon youth.</line>

<line>Crew cut.</line>

<line>How about Adam Clarke?</line>

<line>Long.</line>

<line>Yeah, but a lot of people
had long hair back then.</line>

<line>And Adam came clean
about being an informant.</line>

<line>FBI wasn't gonna confirm.</line>

<line>Put himself in harm's way.</line>

<line>Unless he practices what he preaches.</line>

"<line>People who win face the real facts
of whatever situation they're in."</line>

<line>Maybe he looked at the odds,</line>

<line>knew we'd make him as the informant,
with or without confirmation.</line>

<line>So he steps out ahead of us.</line>

<line>Make himself look good.</line>

<line>And sets up Charlie.</line>

"<line>Audacious action, with the element of
surprise, will give you the upper hand."</line>

<line>We know Adam followed
Charlie around for a week.</line>

<line>He saw where he worked.</line>

<line>Could've dumped the
bodies there one night.</line>

<line>Which points right to Charlie
if anything ever comes to light.</line>

<line>And Adam gets years
to have a life...</line>

<line>till his luck runs out.</line>

<line>We got enough to compel a DNA sample?</line>

<line>I mean, this guy ain't gonna give it up.</line>

<line>He already did.</line>

<line>Those pictures,
they were real helpful, Adam.</line>

<line>I'm glad.</line>

<line>You're an excellent photographer.</line>

<line>Composition, framing...</line>

<line>Especially framing.</line>

<line>How'd it go down, anyway?</line>

<line>You get sloppy that day,
Julia and Gerard catch you?</line>

<line>I... don't follow.</line>

<line>Charlie didn't k*ll them.</line>

<line>Good try, though.</line>

<line>I never said he did.</line>

<line>Adam Clarke --
real hippie or... poser?</line>

<line>Real.</line>

<line>My passions were very real.</line>

<line>How'd you like having long hair?</line>

<line>All them strands blowing around.</line>

<line>And guess what, Adam?</line>

<line>One of them blew right into the plastic
bags you wrapped your friends in.</line>

<line>Got stuck under the tape.</line>

<line>A long, brown hair that don't
belong to either of them.</line>

<line>You think I was the only guy with long
hair those two were in contact with?</line>

<line>Well, the DNA on this will confirm it.</line>

<line>Whether you were a real
hippie or not doesn't matter.</line>

<line>Your long hair got you in the end.</line>

<line>Why'd you do it Adam?</line>

<line>Were you against
what "Jane" was doing?</line>

<line>I thought they were heroic.</line>

<line>I didn't want Julia or
Gerard to be harmed.</line>

<line>But then they found out about you.</line>

<line>Pretty soon the whole movement would
know you were a snitch for the FBI.</line>

<line>The Feds had me.</line>

<line>I had no options.</line>

<line>How about taking responsibility?</line>

<line>Ain't that the winner's way?</line>

<line>I was a leader in the revolution.</line>

<line>We were living like it meant something.</line>

<line>I loved that life.</line>

<line>Couldn't stand to give it up.</line>

<line>Ever wonder if Julia
and Gerard felt that way?</line>

<line>Think they loved their lives?</line>

<line>Hey, Jules.</line>

<line>Gerard.</line>

<line>What are you guys doing here?</line>

<line>What's going on, Adam?</line>

<line>You taking our pictures?</line>

<line>I'm always taking pictures.</line>

<line>Yeah, what : in the morning,
on a deserted corner?</line>

<line>I-I don't get this.</line>

<line>Oh, man.</line>

<line>This is sad.</line>

<line>He's a snitch.</line>

<line>Come on, Adam Clarke?</line>

<line>Who better?</line>

<line>This is crazy, right?</line>

<line>Let's...</line>

<line>Let's get in the car. / Adam.</line>

<line>Just do it, Jules.</line>

<line>The man of peace and
love has a handgun?</line>

<line>No, he ain't that man at all.</line>

<line>Just get in the car.</line>

<line>Crank the radio, Gerard.</line>

<line>Turn it up.</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Adam, please, no...</line>

<line>I'm sorry.</line>
