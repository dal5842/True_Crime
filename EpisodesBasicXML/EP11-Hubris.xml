<line>Detective Rush, cold jobs.</line>

<line>Uh, Roy Minard,</line>

<line>uh, Fallen from Grace.</line>

<line>Is that right?</line>

<line>Yes.</line>

<line>You're looking at a
ruined man, I'm afraid.</line>

<line>Wanna sit down?</line>

<line>Thank you.</line>

<line>I was a, uh...</line>

<line>I was a professor at the University,</line>

<line>enjoying a quiet life
of arts and sciences</line>

<line>when I became embroiled
in a m*rder case.</line>

<line>My unfortunate role was as
the number one suspect.</line>

<line>Who had the unfortunate
role of victim?</line>

<line>Uh...</line>

<line>Holly Richardson.</line>

<line>Here.</line>

<line>She was one of my students.</line>

<line>Very promising young mind.</line>

<line>k*lled on Campus?</line>

<line>Nine years ago.</line>

<line>Whipped and strangled
with a car antenna.</line>

<line>Awful.</line>

<line>Well, there must have been a
reason you were investigated.</line>

<line>And one reason only.</line>

<line>Holly and I were having an affair.</line>

<line>Ah.</line>

<line>Which I lied about at the time.</line>

<line>Why?</line>

<line>Why does a philanderer lie?</line>

<line>I was married.</line>

<line>Ashamed of my behavior.</line>

<line>Covering your tracks.</line>

<line>And my dishonesty on that matter</line>

<line>was seen as guilty in this
far more serious charge.</line>

<line>The press went to town.</line>

<line>My wife and child left town...</line>

<line>and I was soon relieved of
my professorship</line>

<line>and banned from campus.</line>

<line>Well, you're here talking to me,</line>

<line>so clearly you weren't
convicted of anything.</line>

<line>Not in a court of law.</line>

<line>And you're innocent, of course.</line>

<line>You've heard of Richard Jewell?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>He and I would have a lot to talk about.</line>

<line>So why come in today, Roy?</line>

<line>Uh, I found this</line>

<line>in the newspaper.</line>

<line>A prost*tute in Norristown</line>

was k*lled and dumped in
<line>the Schuylkill two weeks ago.</line>

<line>Same as Holly.</line>

<line>A lot of bodies are
dumped in the river.</line>

<line>Yes, but this one was also k*lled</line>

<line>with a car antenna.</line>

<line>I saw that and I, uh,</line>

<line>I thought maybe I've
found my one-armed man.</line>

<line>Now you're Richard Kimble.</line>

<line>If there is a connection,</line>

<line>maybe you can solve two murders.</line>

<line>And save my life in the process.</line>

"<line>Holly Richardson, .</line>

<line>k*lled in West Philly, May ' .</line>

<line>lashes with an antenna</line>

<line>before he strangled her with it."</line>

<line>Little humiliation
before the grand finale.</line>

<line>Dumped in the Schuylkill.</line>

<line>Doer was probably trying
to wash away evidence.</line>

<line>They found semen.</line>

<line>Professor Minard's?</line>

<line>Yup.</line>

<line>So they did it the
night of the m*rder.</line>

<line>Outside of that, what do we got?</line>

<line>He and Holy were at
the same party at the...</line>

<line>Elizabethan Club.</line>

<line>Some people saw them having words.</line>

"<line>Words."</line>

<line>I love how them Ivy Leaguers talk.</line>

<line>They had a fight, okay, Dummy?</line>

<line>So that's the whole case?</line>

<line>That's about it.</line>

<line>That's nothing.</line>

<line>Why'd this guy get the pinch?</line>

<line>He lied about the affair
till the DNA came back.</line>

<line>Then he changed his story.</line>

<line>How's the Norristown
m*rder come into play?</line>

<line>This hooker job had
a pretty similar M.O.,</line>

<line>the antenna, the river dump.</line>

<line>Worth getting a look
at that Norristown file.</line>

<line>Vera won't mind taking a ride.</line>

<line>This professor still
teaching Art History?</line>

<line>English as a second language.</line>

<line>Step or two down.</line>

<line>Paid a high price if he's innocent.</line>

<line>Or if he's guilty,</line>

<line>he's gotten a lot of free years.</line>

<line>So, we reinvestigate him, too.</line>

<line>Hi, we meet again.
Excuse me.</line>

<line>Professor Minard,
my partner Scotty Valens.</line>

<line>Hi.</line>

<line>Hi. Thank you.</line>

<line>You're very kind to
call me "professor",</line>

<line>but around here I'm just "Mr. Roy."</line>

<line>Yeah, okay.</line>

<line>So does this visit mean</line>

<line>there was something to
my amateur detective's theory?</line>

<line>We don't know yet.</line>

<line>I've filled a lot of time the
last nine years</line>

<line>reading mystery novels.</line>

<line>I thought maybe I was
getting carried away.</line>

<line>Well, we haven't seen the
file from Norristown yet.</line>

<line>But we were wondering where you were</line>

<line>the uh, night that hooker got k*lled.</line>

<line>Right, um...</line>

<line>I teach here nights,
Mondays through Thursday.</line>

<line>What night was she k*lled?</line>

<line>It was a Tuesday.</line>

<line>Then I was here.</line>

<line>other witnesses
will tell you the same,</line>

<line>in broken but improving English.</line>

<line>Lying about your affair with Holly</line>

<line>got you in a lot of hot water.</line>

<line>I was arrogant.</line>

<line>Bill Clinton lied to America
about the intern.</line>

<line>I lied to Philadelphia.</line>

<line>And you both got caught in the end.</line>

<line>I wouldn't do it again.</line>

<line>DNA...</line>

<line>will get you every time.</line>

<line>So when Holly was k*lled,</line>

<line>how were you two getting along?</line>

<line>Well, in my first statement,</line>

<line>I said things were great.</line>

<line>I know.</line>

<line>But to be honest,</line>

<line>there was some tension.</line>

<line>If I had a small dinner
party, would you come?</line>

<line>Small, as in you and me?</line>

<line>Maybe six people or eight.</line>

<line>No, I wouldn't.</line>

<line>Why not?</line>

<line>Holly... there are rules.</line>

<line>Well, I wanna see you in public.</line>

<line>You can't.</line>

<line>God, don't you ever even think
about me outside this office?</line>

<line>Sure. Thinking is perfectly fair.</line>

<line>Seeing each other outside
of these four walls...</line>

<line>it's not possible.</line>

<line>What if I don't like
those rules anymore?</line>

<line>Sounds like you laid
it out pretty clear.</line>

<line>My campus and my home life
stayed separate.</line>

<line>No contact outside of office hours.</line>

<line>Is that what you called it?</line>

<line>Not even phone calls.</line>

<line>Here's the deal, Roy.</line>

<line>If we're gonna look
at this case again,</line>

<line>you gotta be an open book this time.</line>

<line>Done.</line>

<line>In fact...</line>

<line>Here it is.</line>

<line>What is it?</line>

<line>It's a list of women,</line>

<line>who were also...</line>

<line>Conquests?</line>

<line>Did you offer these names</line>

<line>in the first investigation?</line>

<line>No, I was pretending
Holly was the only one.</line>

<line>They'll probably badmouth me.</line>

<line>You'll hear a lot about bad behavior,</line>

<line>but nothing that says "m*rder."</line>

<line>I was sick in love with that jerk.</line>

<line>I see you took two different art history
courses with him, spring of ' .</line>

<line>Hm, 'cause I couldn't
get enough of him.</line>

<line>You know how vile it is
to know you were with a m*rder*r?</line>

<line>Why do you think he's a m*rder*r?</line>

<line>I read the papers.</line>

<line>He told City Magazine</line>

<line>he didn't do anything
to "hurt that girl."</line>

<line>Pretty strange word choice,</line>

<line>don't you think?</line>

<line>Was he ever violent with you?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Possessive? Scary, at all?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>But you still think maybe
he could have whipped</line>

and strangled with
<line>this Holly to death.</line>

<line>I read the papers.</line>

<line>He toyed with me
my whole sophomore year.</line>

<line>Treated you bad?</line>

<line>Like a piece of a*s.</line>

<line>Seduced me with poetry and wine
during office hours...</line>

pretended not to know me
<line>if I saw him on campus.</line>

<line>You think he m*rder*d Holly?</line>

<line>He got a lawyer pretty fast.</line>

<line>I'll tell you a secret, Monique,</line>

<line>that's actually the smart thing to do.</line>

<line>Seems like the guilty
thing to do, to me.</line>

<line>Roy Minard...</line>

<line>I wouldn't say that name
too loudly around here.</line>

<line>We need to know about
your relationship with him.</line>

<line>In ' ?</line>

<line>I'm on the faculty now.</line>

<line>It'd be bad for me if that got out.</line>

<line>Is that why you kept it from
the police nine years ago?</line>

<line>I was never asked.</line>

<line>Look, this isn't popular
opinion around campus,</line>

<line>but Roy didn't k*ll Holly.</line>

<line>You don't think so?</line>

<line>He was unethical but
he's not a m*rder*r.</line>

<line>You didn't think he
was unethical in ' .</line>

<line>I didn't really get what an abuse</line>

<line>it was until I started teaching.</line>

<line>It's just so easy to impress students.</line>

<line>And Roy's very charismatic.</line>

<line>We've met him.</line>

<line>Did you know Holly Richardson?</line>

<line>I tried to warn her not to
get in too deep with Roy.</line>

<line>I talked to her that night
at the Elizabethan Club.</line>

<line>It's not so easy seeing
them in the flesh, is it?</line>

<line>What?
- The wife, the kid.</line>

<line>No, it's not.</line>

<line>Holly, this time last year,
I was standing right where you are.</line>

<line>Did you feel like you'd
just been hit by a truck?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>He's happy with them.
He won't leave.</line>

<line>Why does he have affairs
if he's so happy?</line>

<line>I don't know his psychology.</line>

<line>But there's a new girl every year.</line>

<line>And the year's almost over.</line>

<line>I think it's different this time.</line>

<line>I felt for her.
I, I was her at one point.</line>

<line>But she was upset at him...
not the other way around.</line>

<line>So after two hours of making copies</line>

of every page from
<line>this Norristown job...</line>

<line>Stillman told us
about the flat tire.</line>

<line>Yeah, that precinct's copier
was from the mimeograph era.</line>

<line>Look, guys, it was bad luck.</line>

<line>Yeah, well, we finish
up your dog call,</line>

finally get out of
<line>traffic on Ridge Pike...</line>

<line>prost*tute's name was Lenore Grandy.</line>

<line>And bam!</line>

<line>And we were in the fast lane.</line>

<line>Vera, Jeffries thank you.</line>

<line>You risked your very
lives for this job.</line>

<line>Hey, guys, can we talk about
Lenore Grandy now?</line>

<line>Whipped times with a car antenna,</line>

<line>then strangled with it.</line>

<line>And dumped in the Schuylkill.</line>

<line>That's just like Holly.</line>

<line>But here's the money.</line>

<line>Lonore... Holly.</line>

<line>Wow...</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Gotta be the same doer.</line>

<line>How did no one catch this?</line>

<line>Different counties.
Computer don't talk.</line>

<line>Roy Minard have an alibi
for the second m*rder?</line>

<line>Teaching his class that
night. It checked out.</line>

<line>Maybe he did get the Jewell treatment.</line>

<line>I got something we can run with.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Cross-referenced</line>

the names from vice
<line>sweeps in Norristown</line>

<line>with the university alumni records.</line>

<line>Two hits.</line>

<line>Clarence Grimes.</line>

<line>Graduated years ago.</line>

<line>He wouldn't know Holly.</line>

<line>Yeah, but Barry Tepler would.</line>

<line>He was in school same time as her.</line>

<line>He only lives eight blocks
from where Lenore was dumped.</line>

<line>I don't have... people over...</line>

<line>We're here about Holly Richardson.</line>

<line>Don't bring her up.</line>

<line>Why not?</line>

<line>I stay away from Holly,
just like she told me to.</line>

<line>Holly told you stay away, Barry?</line>

<line>She invited me home for Thanksgiving...</line>

<line>I misinterpreted her
gesture of friendship</line>

<line>for a deeper interest,</line>

<line>but I changed my behavior
when she relayed her true feelings.</line>

<line>Your therapist tell you that?</line>

<line>Or lawyer?</line>

<line>When she asked me to
leave her alone... I did.</line>

<line>Hi.</line>

<line>What you doing here?</line>

<line>I go to school here.</line>

<line>Well, you don't have any
classes in Williams Hall.</line>

<line>I wanted to see you.</line>

<line>Barry, you're following me.</line>

<line>I like you.</line>

<line>I'm not interested in you in that way.</line>

<line>You took me to meet your parents.</line>

<line>It was Thanksgiving.</line>

<line>You had nowhere else to go.</line>

<line>Well, can we talk about it, or...</line>

<line>No. Nope.</line>

<line>I don't wanna talk about it,</line>

<line>I don't want you to
call me or follow me.</line>

<line>Uh-huh.</line>

<line>And I don't want any more letters.</line>

<line>Those are yours.</line>

<line>No, they're yours.</line>

<line>So you stalked Holly.</line>

<line>I pursued her with
too much enthusiasm.</line>

<line>You still have those letters, Barry?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>You save dental reminders
from three years ago,</line>

<line>but not those letters?</line>

<line>I... I was in my dorm room
when she was k*lled.</line>

<line>Where were you
when Lenore Grandy was k*lled?</line>

<line>I don't know who that is.</line>

<line>A hooker.</line>

<line>m*rder*d December th,
eight blocks from here.</line>

<line>That's a Tuesday.
Tuesdays I paint.</line>

<line>I have therapy at : ,</line>

<line>then I go to Wawa for a Red Bull,</line>

<line>uh, get a Newsweek,
I'm home by : .</line>

<line>Plenty of time for
prost*tute on that schedule.</line>

<line>I don't use prostitutes.</line>

<line>Risperdol.</line>

<line>You got schizophrenia?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Hear voices?</line>

<line>God talking through the garbage?</line>

<line>I'm better now.</line>

<line>It's tough getting better.</line>

<line>You stop, taking these, you
can fall into psychotic behavior.</line>

<line>I take'em.</line>

<line>Well, maybe you lapsed</line>

<line>right around December th,
voices started saying</line>

<line>you should hurt that hooker.</line>

<line>I don't go near those whores!</line>

<line>Yeah, he comes here all the time.</line>

<line>Hangs around and tries to talk to us.</line>

<line>He ever talk to your friend Lenore?</line>

<line>Oh, he especially liked her.</line>

<line>Stared at her from across the street.</line>

<line>He the one k*lled her?</line>

<line>Uh, we don't know.</line>

<line>I figured it was a bad John did it.</line>

<line>This kid was never Lenore's trick?</line>

<line>Mm-mm.</line>

<line>He walked up to her once, though.</line>

<line>Said he loved her flaxen hair</line>

<line>and asked would she go back with him.</line>

<line>She go?
- Hell, no!</line>

<line>He didn't have no money.</line>

<line>Man! I never would've thought
it could've been this creep.</line>

<line>We don't know that it is, Trish.</line>

<line>You know...</line>

<line>I thought you guys
would've blown Lenore off.</line>

<line>Dead hooker, who cares?</line>

<line>No one's getting blown off.</line>

<line>Come here.</line>

<line>I wanna show you something.</line>

<line>Get in.</line>

<line>Hey! Not you, her.</line>

<line>Tight fit in here, huh?</line>

<line>I'm not staying anywhere right now.</line>

<line>Lenore and me met while we were
studying to be beauticians.</line>

<line>We hit it off right away.</line>

<line>Look. That's us.</line>

<line>Best friend, huh?</line>

<line>Figured you should have a real
picture of her, not some mug shot.</line>

<line>What's this one?</line>

<line>Oh...</line>

<line>Lenore had this rich John.</line>

<line>He was gonna divorce,</line>

<line>so he gave Lenore the diamond earings
he had just bought for his wife.</line>

<line>Nice.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Instead of just keeping it for herself,</line>

<line>she gives me one.</line>

<line>We made friendship rings...
but for the belly.</line>

<line>Lenore had the other one, huh?</line>

<line>She wore it all the time.</line>

<line>Any mention of a diamond belly
ring in the Norristown report?</line>

<line>Uh, no. Doer probably took it.</line>

<line>You the Detectives?</line>

<line>Rush and Valens.</line>

<line>This is difficult for us.</line>

<line>We only had one child.</line>

<line>We understand.</line>

<line>We already know who k*lled our daughter.</line>

<line>Uh, we have another suspect
we wanna ask you about.</line>

<line>Hmm. Maybe I wasn't clear.</line>

<line>Roy Minard k*lled Holly.</line>

<line>Maybe I wasn't clear.</line>

<line>We're Homicide and
we're looking at someone else.</line>

<line>Who?</line>

<line>Barry Tepler.</line>

<line>He went to college with Holly.</line>

<line>He was here for Thanksgiving.</line>

<line>That kid was harmless.</line>

<line>Mr. Richardson,
if someone else is responsible,</line>

- don't you wanna know that?
<line>I know who k*lled Holly.</line>

<line>A father knows.</line>

<line>Well, Barry was infatuated
with your daughter.</line>

<line>So was Minard.</line>

<line>I'll come back early,
if you break the rules</line>

<line>and come see a movie with me in public.</line>

<line>I gotta go. My mom has the cake out.</line>

<line>Is that for me?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>A ticket to Paris?</line>

<line>Who was that on the phone?
- A friend from school.</line>

<line>A man called for you earlier.</line>

<line>Dad, I'm not a kid.</line>

<line>Then talk to me like an adult.</line>

<line>Um... he is my art history professor.</line>

<line>He seduced her.</line>

<line>He fell in love with her...
and who wouldn't?</line>

<line>She was just so damn special.</line>

<line>Thought you kept your
home and campus life separate, Roy.</line>

<line>Not even a phone call.
Ain't that what he said?</line>

<line>That's right.</line>

<line>Except you called
Holly on her birthday.</line>

<line>At her parents' house.</line>

<line>That's right. I did.</line>

<line>Open book.</line>

<line>You remember, Roy?
- I'd forgotten about that.</line>

<line>And maybe you were a little more invested
in Holly than you're telling us.</line>

<line>You got some other motive here, Minard?</line>

<line>My motive was to get my life
and my career back.</line>

<line>As far as the phone call's concerned,</line>

<line>Holly... insisted that I
call her on her birthday.</line>

<line>Said if I didn't,
she was gonna call me.</line>

<line>So what? You said your wife
knew about the affairs.</line>

<line>Knowing about it in
the back of your mind</line>

<line>and hearing a girl's
voice on the line...</line>

<line>they're two differnt things.</line>

<line>Holly told her dad she broke
things off with you in April.</line>

<line>But you were still
going strong in May.</line>

<line>You'd tell your dad the truth
about your sex life?</line>

<line>What's all that?</line>

<line>Two hundred and twenty-eight...</line>

<line>articles on Roy Minard...</line>

<line>m*rder*r.</line>

<line>The President's Award
for Outstanding Lecturer.</line>

<line>Why can't they put that on the news?</line>

<line>People like a story.</line>

<line>You're a postmodernist.</line>

<line>A what?</line>

<line>Well, that's the crux
of the theory, anyway.</line>

<line>Social construction of reality.</line>

<line>What are you talking about?</line>

<line>Society needs a narrative.</line>

<line>You know, given seemingly
random facts and events,</line>

<line>we need to weave them into a story.</line>

<line>Otherwise, the world
wouldn't make any sense.</line>

<line>I can see that.</line>

<line>How do we process
this beautiful young girl dying?</line>

<line>We can't.</line>

<line>Not without a perpetrator.</line>

<line>And so, if one isn't
obvious, we find one.</line>

<line>We assign the blame.</line>

<line>It makes the story complete.</line>

<line>It's an action-- explanation.</line>

<line>Order restored.</line>

<line>Why people gotta believe in God, too.</line>

<line>Mm-hmm. Exactly.</line>

<line>Too many unanswerables without Him.</line>

<line>Makes some sense.</line>

<line>Well, I'd be even more fascinated
if I weren't the foil of it all,</line>

<line>but, yes, it does.</line>

<line>It makes some sense.</line>

<line>Kite!</line>

<line>Uh, office is closed, Rush.</line>

<line>Seven O'clock?</line>

<line>Yeah, well, spare me
the Homicide mantra:</line>

"<line>When your days ends,
ours just begins."</line>

<line>It's true.
- Yeah, I've seen the T-shirt.</line>

<line>I don't know what I'd do with myself
if I went home at : .</line>

<line>Uh, you remember the
Holly Richardson job?</line>

<line>Yeah, everybody wanted that one.</line>

<line>Why? There's nothing on it.</line>

<line>Pretty Ivy League girl,
philandering professor,</line>

<line>kind of case gets you on Court TV.</line>

<line>Where you'd look like a fool,
'cause the commonwealth had crap?</line>

<line>I guess. Have you eaten?</line>

<line>Look, I need a search warrant
on this kid Barry.</line>

<line>Do you know any Norristown DA's?</line>

<line>- 'Cause I haven't eaten.
- I need it right away.</line>

<line>This kid knows we're looking at him.</line>

<line>Sit with me. We'll run the case.</line>

<line>Or we can do it tomorrow.
I've got, like, minutes at : .</line>

<line>Barry Tepler fits for both jobs.</line>

<line>Oh, I got a narrative on him.</line>

<line>A what?</line>

<line>A story that adds up.</line>

<line>He had it bad for Holly, right?</line>

<line>Gets rejected by her.</line>

<line>Then he's hanging around this hooker
Lenore the last few months.</line>

<line>Who he claims he didn't know.</line>

<line>Who also rejected him.</line>

<line>Both girls are end
up dead in the water.</line>

<line>Well, if he's so in love with'em,</line>

<line>why no sexual element to these murders?</line>

<line>Well, Barry's schizophrenic.</line>

<line>A lot of people with that
condition, no sex drive.</line>

<line>And the voices you here,
they're powerful.</line>

<line>They tell you to k*ll
someone, you do it.</line>

<line>You're, uh, knowledgeable, huh?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>I know someone.</line>

<line>Where's Lil?</line>

<line>Asking a warrant for Barry's.</line>

<line>To find the h**ker's belly ring,
those letters to Holly.</line>

<line>Maybe he starts owning up.</line>

<line>All right.</line>

<line>Good night, Scotty.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>So Roy Minard is innocent after all?</line>

<line>Hard to assume anything</line>

<line>but this Barry kid makes...</line>

<line>more sense.</line>

<line>So what's he like Minard?</line>

<line>Kind of a cad.</line>

<line>But a charming one?</line>

<line>I guess.</line>

<line>So you figure a guy's bad news
if he mixes work and pleasure?</line>

<line>I don't have a big opinion on that.</line>

<line>Hmm.</line>

<line>So, uh, I'll call this
Norristown guy in the morning.</line>

<line>How come we always talk about work?</line>

'<line>Cause we work together.</line>

<line>Well, tell me something personal.</line>

<line>No!</line>

<line>Why not?</line>

<line>Come on, Rush. Why not?</line>

<line>Because...</line>

<line>I'm bad at that, and...</line>

<line>I gotta go.</line>

<line>Well, let me walk you.</line>

<line>I'll be fine! I'm packing.
- Uh, watch...!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</line>

<line>You know... stand still, okay?</line>

<line>What are you doing?</line>

<line>I'm gonna kiss you.</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Just give it a try.</line>

<line>Come on...</line>

<line>Come on, Rush.</line>

<line>All you, all you gotta
do is stand there.</line>

<line>Don't panic.</line>

<line>It's over in three seconds.</line>

<line>Um...</line>

<line>So sit with that overnight and, uh...</line>

<line>see how it settles in.</line>

<line>Everything has its place.
Everything has its...</line>

<line>Everything has its place.</line>

<line>Read the warrant; we got a right.</line>

<line>Why are you doing this to me?</line>

<line>What did I do wrong?</line>

<line>You lied about that</line>

<line>flaxen-haired hooker,
asking her home and all.</line>

<line>I just wanted to paint her.</line>

<line>Pay dirt.</line>

<line>Guess you lied about having
these letters to Holly, too.</line>

<line>Please don't take those.</line>

<line>Got to read'em, Barry.</line>

<line>They sent you to ruin my life.</line>

<line>I know...</line>

<line>they watch outside in the shadows,</line>

<line>in the closet, behind the coats...</line>

<line>Stress is bringing on an episode.</line>

<line>You think I can't hear them?</line>

<line>Take him out for some air, will you?</line>

<line>That high pitch? Huh?</line>

<line>Like a whistle?</line>

<line>That tries to make you crazy?</line>

<line>What's it say?</line>

"<line>To my Holly:</line>

<line>If thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool</line>

<line>for wise men know well enough</line>

<line>what monsters you make of them."</line>

<line>Some kind of poetry?</line>

<line>Maybe Shakespeare?</line>

<line>No belly ring at Barry's?</line>

<line>Mm. Turned his place inside out.</line>

<line>Maybe sold it for cash.</line>

"<line>Who set this</line>

<line>ancient quarrel new abroach?"</line>

<line>What the hell? I thought this was
about a girl on a balcony.</line>

<line>Just find the quote
from Barry's letter.</line>

<line>Well, hold up.</line>

"<line>Is your name Shylock?"</line>

<line>That's not the quote.</line>

<line>I know-- it's just the first thing</line>

<line>I've understood in about an hour.</line>

<line>It's here, in Hamlet.</line>

<line>Thank God.</line>

"<line>If thou wilt needs marry,</line>

<line>marry a fool;</line>

<line>for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.</line>

<line>To a nunnery, go, and quickly, too."</line>



<line>Hamlet says it to Ophelia.</line>

<line>Looks like it was a
one-sided kind of love.</line>

<line>He rejects her.</line>

<line>But Barry was the one rejected.
- Right.</line>

<line>Flip to the back.
How's it end?</line>

<line>Uh, she... goes mad and drowns.</line>

<line>Both our vics were found in the drink.</line>

<line>The "drink"?
You the Bard now?</line>

<line>Monster could mean... Barry's illness.</line>

<line>He blames it on Holly?
- Let's find out.</line>

<line>About that belly ring, Scotty's right.</line>

<line>Barry could've sold it, you wanna check
consignment and pawn shops?</line>

<line>Yeah. Once I'm finished with
this scintillating play.</line>

<line>Selling or buying?</line>

<line>Buying.</line>

<line>Pawn shop on the corner said
you might have what we want.</line>

<line>Don't give that Schmuck your business.</line>

<line>The schmuck that has this...</line>

<line>diamond belly ring...</line>

<line>is the one gets our business.</line>

<line>Just got some vintage cufflinks.</line>

<line>The belly ring.</line>

<line>That's all we want.</line>

<line>You're missing out, fellas.</line>

<line>They're tigereye.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>This what you had in mind?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Exactly.</line>

<line>Nice stone. Two carats.</line>

<line>How much?</line>

<line>Ten Bens.</line>

<line>Call the seller--</line>

<line>tell him to come down here
and collect his dough.</line>

<line>So you saw you and Holly as a kind of
modern-day Hamlet and Ophelia, huh?</line>

<line>So?</line>

<line>That didn't end well
for that chick in the play, Barry.</line>

<line>Didn't end well for Holly, either.</line>

<line>It's just a letter.</line>

"<line>Wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them."</line>

<line>You saying she made you into a monster?</line>

<line>No, passion. Passion is the monster.</line>

<line>I just...I...</line>

<line>I wanted to get her attention,</line>

<line>show her I was sensitive.</line>

<line>Not like that old...
guy she was seeing.</line>

<line>Oh, you knew about Minard?</line>

<line>He shouldn't date students.</line>

<line>It's not an equal relationship.</line>

<line>So when Holly was stupid enough</line>

<line>not to be moved by
your borrowed poetry...</line>

<line>Throw those letters back in your face.</line>

<line>When she stayed in her unequal
relationship with Minard,</line>

<line>and told you to leave
her the hell alone,</line>

<line>you wanted to punish her.</line>

<line>Followed her that night,</line>

<line>snapped off an antenna,
then whip, whip, whip,</line>

<line>strangel, strangle.</line>

<line>Splash.</line>

<line>I saw her that night.</line>

<line>But I only talked to her.</line>

<line>Are you okay?</line>

<line>Mm-hmm.</line>

<line>Well, I know I'm...
I'm not supposed to come near you...</line>

<line>No, it's all right, you can.</line>

<line>I, uh...</line>

<line>Oh.</line>

<line>What happened?</line>

<line>I found out what a b*tch I am.</line>

<line>You're not a b*tch.</line>

<line>I saw Minard's wife... and their kid.</line>

<line>They're real.</line>

<line>I pretended they weren't, but...</line>

<line>they're a family.</line>

<line>Guy's not right for you anyway.</line>

<line>Oh. Well, he doesn't think so.</line>

<line>He wants to stay together.</line>

<line>Really?</line>

<line>But, you know, the truth is,</line>

<line>I don't care about him.</line>

<line>I was just playing a game,</line>

<line>but I... I don't love him.</line>

<line>Maybe...</line>

<line>Maybe you could love me.</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>I'll never love you, either.</line>

<line>Girl you love says that to you,</line>

<line>and you just... get up
and go back to the dorm?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>We didn't hear it like that, Barry.</line>

<line>We heard Holly was pissed off
at Minard after that party.</line>

<line>Lil.</line>

<line>What's going on?</line>

<line>Holly's mother called.</line>

<line>I won't fight you.</line>

<line>I don't care how many
times you hit me,</line>

<line>Mr. Richardson.
- I'm not gonna hit you back.</line>

<line>This won't solve anything.</line>

<line>You won't take care of this guy,</line>

<line>I'll do it myself.</line>

<line>I am taking care of it.
I'm reinvestigating.</line>

<line>Holly was an innocent girl,</line>

<line>and this bastard...</line>

- took advantage...
<line>I was wrong.</line>

<line>Okay? I shouldn't
have been with her.</line>

<line>You have every reason
to hate me for that,</line>

<line>but I did not hurt Holly.</line>

<line>Don't say that.</line>

<line>I know you did it. I know it.</line>

<line>Please let me handle this.</line>

<line>I miss her.</line>

<line>I know.</line>

<line>Holly was special.</line>

<line>M-Maybe you don't
wanna hear that from me,</line>

<line>but she talked about you all the time.</line>

<line>She adored you.</line>

<line>I know he did it.</line>

<line>Whoa.</line>

<line>Hey...</line>

<line>Did you get that warrant okay?
- I did.</line>

<line>All right.
- Thanks. / Yeah.</line>

<line>I guess we won't talk
about the other thing.</line>

<line>Yeah. Okay.
- Okay</line>

<line>Shut up.</line>

<line>Who's this?</line>

<line>Jesus Torres. Ex-con.</line>

<line>Tried to sell Lenore Grandy's belly ring.</line>

<line>What's he sayin'?</line>

<line>Some not so nice about Vera's sister.</line>

<line>Well, looks like you
got two suspects now.</line>

<line>This ring belonged to Lenore Grandy,</line>

<line>the hooker you k*lled up in Norristown.</line>

<line>I tell you,</line>

<line>told you, I didn't k*ll no one.</line>

<line>What's your parole officer
gonna think all about this?</line>

<line>Six months out and you already
got ties to two murders.</line>

<line>Two?</line>

<line>Yeah. Lenore Grandy, two weeks ago,</line>

<line>Holly Richardson in ' . Same doer.</line>

<line>They say "Jesus has
not adjusted to life</line>

<line>after prison the way we had hoped."</line>

<line>Maybe I took the diamond.</line>

<line>Now, that's a start.</line>

<line>Yeah, but it ain't like you say.</line>

<line>Hmm.</line>

<line>What is it like?</line>

<line>I go to the river.</line>

<line>I find the girl dead already, in the water.</line>

<line>I see the ring.</line>

<line>I think, she don't need it now, right?</line>

<line>Nah, she's iced.</line>

<line>That's all I do.</line>

<line>I steal from someone
don't need it anymore.</line>

<line>Now, here's my vision for
what happened, Barry.</line>

<line>You met Lenore in your hood,</line>

<line>fell in love with that flaxen hair,</line>

<line>which was a lot like Holly's...</line>

<line>Holly was a honey blonde.</line>

<line>...and thought, "Well,
here's a Holly look-alike,</line>

<line>and she's just a hooker.</line>

<line>Maybe I can get this one."</line>

<line>I just wanted to paint
Lenore; I'm a painter.</line>

<line>But then she gives you the high hat.</line>

<line>Rejected by a whore.</line>

<line>That's humiliating.</line>

<line>The last straw.</line>

<line>So you figure, let me</line>

give this b*tch the same treatment
<line>I gave Holly.</line>

<line>I gotta show you something.</line>

<line>You study the pre-Raphaelites
there, Jesus?</line>

<line>Que? What?</line>

<line>John Everett Millais
one of your favorites?</line>

<line>It's called "Ophelia".</line>

<line>I never saw that.</line>

<line>But you do recognize that, uh,</line>

<line>Lenore was posed just
like poor Ophelia here.</line>

<line>I don't know nothing about paintings.</line>

<line>No?</line>

<line>All I did was steal the ring.</line>

<line>She was layin' in the water...</line>

<line>lyin' in the water already dead.</line>

<line>Say that again.</line>

<line>She was lyin' in the water dead.</line>

<line>Chickens lay.
- People lie.</line>

<line>You take ESL with Mr. Roy?</line>

<line>No. Nah.</line>

<line>It's easy to prove, Jesus.
There's a registry for that.</line>

<line>You and him made a deal, didn't you?</line>

m*rder for hire gets you the death penalty
<line>nine times out of ten, Jesus.</line>

<line>Lucky part for you is,
we want Roy more than you.</line>

<line>Tell your side,
we tell the DA you cooperated.</line>

<line>I done this before-- , .</line>

<line>I can't do ten. Five maybe.</line>

<line>Come on, it... it's a hooker.</line>

<line>It'll be the easiest
money you've ever made.</line>

<line>It's so easy, you do it,</line>

<line>and it'll cost you nothing.</line>

<line>I have to be in class
to establish my alibi.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>I do for six.</line>

<line>All right, but remember,
you stick to the script.</line>

<line>Everything's gotta be done exactly
like the way it was last time.</line>

<line>Comprende, Jesus?
- Si.</line>

<line>I end up teaching this
pathetic class, and, uh...</line>

<line>it was all to meet you, my friend.</line>

<line>That's destiny.</line>

<line>I'll be back after this...</line>

<line>where I belong.</line>

<line>Minard, what's destiny?</line>

<line>It's what sets you free.</line>

<line>I thought it was truth.</line>

<line>The truth sets you free.</line>

<line>No. It's destiny. Trust me.</line>

<line>He only pay me $ , .</line>

<line>So I figure I deserved the jewelry.</line>

<line>Seems only fair.</line>

<line>Back inside the Ivy walls.</line>

<line>Yeah, lunch with the dean.</line>

<line>I don't wanna appear too hopeful,</line>

<line>but the head of my old department</line>

<line>in stepping down in the fall.</line>

<line>Getting your name cleared
would help a lot, huh?</line>

<line>It couldn't hurt.</line>

<line>So you'd be glad to know
we have someone in custody.</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Who is it?</line>

<line>Jesus Torres.</line>

<line>A student in your ESL class.</line>

<line>Jesus... No, I'm sorry,
that doesn't ring a bell.</line>

<line>That's not what he says.</line>

<line>He says you told him you k*lled Holly.</line>

<line>What? / And hired him to k*ll
Lenore in a copycat k*lling.</line>

<line>That... that's absurd.</line>

<line>Well, I know you are</line>

<line>the brilliant professor,
and we're just dump cops...</line>

<line>I don't think you're dumb.</line>

...who couldn't possibly
<line>have heard of Ophelia.</line>

<line>I don't think you're dumb.</line>

<line>I just think you're falling for a story.</line>

<line>Almost, Minard.</line>

<line>I almost fell for your story.</line>

<line>But your boy Jesus
screwed up your plan.</line>

<line>And he got greedy,
stole some off the body.</line>

<line>Led us back to you.</line>

<line>Jesus is a lifetime criminal</line>

<line>with a third-world education.</line>

<line>I thought you didn't know him.</line>

<line>You have his word against mine.</line>

<line>It hardly makes a case.</line>

<line>No. But the second body being
posed just like the first,</line>

<line>that makes my case.</line>

<line>Public didn't know those details.</line>

<line>Only Holly's k*ller did.</line>

<line>And who's gonna believe a dummy like
Jesus ever studied art history.</line>

<line>I had to regain my station.</line>

<line>And Jesus offered a way to do that.</line>

<line>You knew about Barry's
letters to Holly.</line>

<line>Calling her his "Ophelia".</line>

<line>She showed me a few of them.</line>

<line>Pillow talk, if you will.</line>

<line>So you just needed to find
another girl to link Barry to.</line>

<line>Make it look like she was
his second Ophelia.</line>

<line>Frame him for both.</line>

<line>Guy's just a schizo,
what's his life worth, anyway?</line>

<line>I contribute.</line>

<line>Don't look at me like
I'm some kind of monster.</line>

<line>Holly shares some of the
blame of this, too.</line>

<line>Oh, really?</line>

<line>What'd Holly do?</line>

<line>She made me love her.</line>

<line>You left angry...</line>

<line>I could tell.</line>

<line>What? What's wrong?</line>

<line>Nothing's wrong.</line>

<line>It's just over.</line>

<line>What makes you say that?</line>

<line>You have a wife.</line>

<line>Then I'll leave her for you.</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>I will. I will.</line>

<line>I really will.</line>

<line>I thought I loved you, but
it was only in a childish way.</line>

<line>You know, this hard-to-get act
is a little juvenile for you.</line>

<line>You know, I just wanted to have fun.</line>

<line>I didn't even think about your family.</line>

<line>Hey...</line>

<line>Did you hear what I just said...
that I love you?</line>

<line>Well, I don't love you.</line>

<line>I don't love anyone.
- Except yourself.</line>

<line>Yeah, and you love you,
and that's why we get along so well.</line>

<line>I say when it's over.</line>

<line>I make the rules.</line>

<line>I decide.</line>

<line>I decide!</line>

<line>I decide!</line>

<line>I decide.</line>
