<line>God bless us nelly queens!</line>

<line>This domestic call</line>

<line>came in every Friday night...
same damn couple.</line>

<line>We're finally shut'em down with
the Blind Policeman routine.</line>

<line>Blind Policeman?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>We go to their door with
a white stick and glasses,</line>

<line>start taking down their report.</line>

<line>Tell'em it's an equal opportunity program.</line>

<line>Grope their faces.</line>

<line>They're so thrown off
they don't call for weeks.</line>

<line>You ever do Blind Policeman</line>

<line>in your patrol days?</line>

<line>Gets'em every time.</line>

<line>The, um...</line>

<line>The lady from Milwaukee is here.</line>

<line>She called twice yesterday
for directions.</line>

<line>And she's an hour early.</line>

<line>Mrs. Holtz?</line>

<line>I know I'm early. I can wait.</line>

<line>No, no, it's fine.</line>

<line>I'm Detective Rush.</line>

<line>This is Detective Valens.</line>

<line>Is it true Milwaukee smells like beer?</line>

<line>I've lived there too long to know.</line>

<line>I haven't been here for a while.</line>

<line>What brings you now?</line>

<line>My son was m*rder*d here in .</line>

<line>He was a student.</line>

<line>A robbery?</line>

<line>They said it was, at first,</line>

<line>and then they said something else...</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>They said he'd been at a gay bar.</line>

<line>My husband and I told them</line>

<line>that was wrong, that Danny</line>

<line>had a girlfriend.</line>

<line>The world has changed so much.</line>

<line>What was your son's name?</line>

<line>Daniel Holtz.</line>

<line>Please, have a seat.</line>

<line>You didn't know your son was gay?</line>

<line>I didn't wanna know.</line>

<line>And now, much too late,</line>

<line>I realize...</line>

<line>that kept me from really knowing him.</line>

<line>Cops back then</line>

<line>talk about other leads?</line>

<line>They mostly talked</line>

<line>about my husband and I being "nice people."</line>

<line>I have a heart condition.</line>

<line>Triple bypass.</line>

<line>I'm running on fumes.</line>

<line>If there's one thing
I want to settle before I go...</line>

<line>I think the police swept this
under the rug.</line>

<line>And my husband and I helped them do it.</line>

<line>We didn't push.</line>

<line>We'll pull his case.</line>

<line>COLD CASE x</line>

<line>I don't see a box.</line>

<line>Holtz with a "Z".</line>

<line>I know. There's no box.</line>

<line>Tough to live with, huh?</line>

<line>She must have told</line>

<line>the assigned detective to lay off.</line>

<line>A civilian tells you to lay off,
you do it?</line>

<line>No. I go harder.</line>

<line>They got jumbled up a lot?</line>

<line>It's getting better.</line>

<line>People are learning the alphabet.</line>

<line>Except Vera.</line>

<line>Not every case is a box job.</line>

<line>If there isn't enough to fill a box...</line>

<line>Here it is.</line>

<line>Living in a group home.</line>

<line>Skimpy, huh?</line>

<line>Doesn't say High Priority.</line>

<line>Body was found in the alley</line>

<line>behind a bar.</line>

<line>In Queen Village. It's perfect.</line>

<line>This case gonna make you uneasy there, Scotty?</line>

<line>Nope.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>' ? That's back when patrol cars were red.</line>

<line>Mm. Random street m*rder.</line>

<line>Assigned detectives are both dead.</line>

<line>A gay bashing outside a bar
that don't exist anymore.</line>

<line>Any you have three civilian interviews.</line>

<line>Sounds like a winner, huh?</line>

<line>We got a shot.</line>

<line>Joined the patron saints of lost causes?</line>

<line>Ain't lost if I'm looking for it.</line>

<line>Whoo, got him to drink the Kool-Aid?</line>

<line>So where you two gonna start?</line>

<line>Crime scene.</line>

<line>Queen Village.</line>

<line>That cracks him up.</line>

<line>Take Jeffries.
Maybe he remembers the bar.</line>

<line>Someone saw what happened.</line>

<line>Someone always does that.</line>

<line>So we'll fine'em. Knock on doors.</line>

<line>Ask neighborhood people.</line>

<line>Someone'll remember our guy.</line>

<line>Another optimist.</line>

<line>The Hush Room was over there.</line>

<line>Corner of Sodom and Gomorrah.</line>

<line>Is that what the cops called it?</line>

<line>It's what the residents called it.</line>

<line>Nice, huh?</line>

<line>Now.</line>

<line>Neighborhood's changed?</line>

<line>Night and day.</line>

<line>All the neighbors are long gone.</line>

<line>Yuppies pushed'em out.</line>

<line>If it was so crappy</line>

<line>how come this Penn kid came
all the way down here?</line>

<line>If you were in gay ' ,
this was the only game in town.</line>

<line>If you wanted to socialize,</line>

<line>this was the only place.</line>

<line>So why was Danny in this alley?</line>

<line>Got chased. Or ambushed.</line>

<line>Or lucky.</line>

<line>How would he have gotten back to
campus in ' .</line>

<line>Subway.</line>

<line>The other direction from the Hush Room.</line>

<line>Maybe he found a friend
who lived thataway?</line>

<line>Caller saw the body</line>

"<line>splayed and protruding in the alley..."</line>

<line>Who called it in?</line>

<line>Anonymous.</line>

<line>Boy, you got nada.</line>

<line>We got a neighbor who saw nothing,</line>

<line>a bartender who knew nothing</line>

<line>and a drag queen called Tinkerbell.</line>

<line>Plus a note tossed in that
Tinkerbell had a lead</line>

<line>on who liked to kick q*eer a*s
in the neighborhood.</line>

<line>Let me guess. No follow-up, right?</line>

<line>Tinkerbell could have been</line>

<line>been a good ID, though.</line>

<line>Like a g*ng moniker.</line>

<line>That's how we find the thugs now.</line>

<line>You wanna look for Tinkerbell?</line>

<line>In Never-Never Land?</line>

<line>Or drag bars.</line>

<line>You sure that's the best job for me?</line>

<line>Definitely.</line>

<line>We should check the old arrest books</line>

<line>at the District Station House.</line>

<line>Figure out who the area bullies were.</line>

<line>I'll go to the district house with you,</line>

<line>you troll the bars with me.</line>

<line>Sure. I ain't scared.</line>

<line>So what violations are we looking for?</line>

<line>There wasn't a code for hate crimes.</line>

<line>Certainly weren't calling it
"gay bashing".</line>

<line>So.... male-on-male assaults?</line>

<line>as*ault, drunk and disorderly,
disturbing the peace,</line>

<line>the whole constellation.</line>

<line>South Philly thugs.</line>

<line>I probably got</line>

<line>relatives in this book.</line>

<line>The Hush Room was managed</line>

<line>by Anthony DeSica from ' to ' .</line>

<line>We'll go and see him.</line>

<line>Our boss, Lieutenant Stillman.</line>

<line>Yes, I remember.</line>

<line>Mrs. Holtz.</line>

<line>Thank you for looking at this case again,</line>

<line>so much time later.</line>

<line>Well, no case is too old to open again.</line>

<line>I never asked before.</line>

<line>Does it say in there
how exactly Danny died?</line>

<line>Blunt force trauma.</line>

<line>Beaten?</line>

<line>Uh, with a round, wooden implement.</line>

<line>Baseball bat, maybe.</line>

<line>Oh, that would be too awful.</line>

<line>There wasn't much Danny loved
more than baseball.</line>

<line>He was on the Penn team.</line>

<line>He must have been a decent player.</line>

<line>Shortstop.</line>

<line>In your original interview, Helen,</line>

<line>you mention Danny's fiancee.</line>

<line>Well, girlfriend.</line>

<line>He said "his girlfriend", at least.</line>

<line>The fiancee part maybe was
my wishful thinking.</line>

<line>What about other friends?</line>

<line>Danny had a lot of friends.</line>

<line>Anyone that could have been
a romantic interest?</line>

<line>Looking back?</line>

<line>You think he'll be there?</line>

<line>We are early.</line>

<line>I don't know,
but my feet are k*lling me.</line>

<line>The Liberty Bell isn't that fascinating.</line>

<line>Oh, I hear him. Danny, it's us.</line>

<line>Honey, are you there?</line>

<line>Okay, Mom, uh, just a second.</line>

<line>This is a friend from the Law School.</line>

<line>We were just studying.</line>

<line>I thought you guys weren't coming back
till later.</line>

<line>I'm late.</line>

<line>I've gotta go.</line>

<line>So nice to meet you.</line>

<line>Did you guys have a good time?</line>

<line>We had a great time.</line>

<line>Your mother loved it.</line>

<line>What time are we meeting Deborah?</line>

<line>I don't even know that boy's name.</line>

<line>I know so little about his life.</line>

<line>Would Deborah know?</line>

<line>Maybe.</line>

<line>Last I heard of her, she was
applying to med school.</line>

<line>You remember her last name?</line>

<line>I could get it.</line>

<line>She wrote us an awfully nice note
when Danny died.</line>

<line>If you find that boy...</line>

<line>or whoever was important to Danny...</line>

<line>will you let him know I'm here.</line>

<line>Sure.</line>

<line>You, uh, still wanna go to the scene, ma'am?</line>

<line>I do...</line>

<line>but I'm feeling too tired now.</line>

<line>Maybe tomorrow.</line>

<line>I'll walk you out.</line>

<line>Hey.</line>

<line>Queen Village</line>

<line>bullies and thugs, circa .</line>

<line>We extrapolated.</line>

<line>Thanks.</line>

<line>You boys have fun tonight.</line>

<line>We wanna talk to you about
the Hush Room, Anthony.</line>

<line>Why you asking about ancient history?</line>

<line>That's the business we're in.</line>

<line>Ralphie, finish this, huh?</line>

<line>Everyone in the place don't need to know</line>

<line>I worked in a q*eer bar.</line>

<line>Yeah, okay.</line>

<line>My uncle owned it. What can I say?</line>

<line>I wasn't his favorite nephew.</line>

<line>I got the booby prize job.</line>

<line>You remember this kid, Danny?</line>

<line>Yeah, I liked him.</line>

<line>He was a baseball nut.</line>

<line>That was the year</line>

<line>the Phillies choked on the pennant race.</line>

<line>They were eight and a half games ahead,</line>

<line>and then they blew</line>

<line>ten straight in a row.</line>

<line>So I had something to talk with him about.</line>

<line>Any idea who k*lled him?</line>

<line>Everybody hated those people.</line>

<line>How about a drag queen called Tinkerbell?</line>

<line>You friendly with her?</line>

<line>They were all Tinkerbells to me.</line>

<line>You remember the night Danny died?</line>

<line>Yeah, 'cause of the raid.</line>

<line>What about it?</line>

<line>Cops was raiding us all the time.</line>

<line>So, we paid them off</line>

<line>to tip us as to when they were coming.</line>

<line>What did you do with the information?</line>

<line>I had a red light behind the bar.</line>

<line>If people were dancing</line>

<line>and the red light started,</line>

<line>they knew to hurry up</line>

<line>and get into boy-girl couples
before the cops got there.</line>

<line>Only that night there was no warning.</line>

<line>How come?</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>Maybe my uncle was late with the payoff.</line>

<line>Cops ever do any damage?</line>

<line>Sure.</line>

<line>Those kind of raids was open season
on them f*gs.</line>

<line>There's nothing on the books</line>

<line>about a police raid.</line>

<line>You're surprised?</line>

<line>This raid happened</line>

<line>the night of a m*rder.</line>

<line>That's pretty significant.</line>

<line>Yeah, well, things were different</line>

<line>back then, Scott.</line>

<line>The department isn't squeaky-clean.</line>

<line>There's a lot that's ugly in our past.</line>

<line>So, now we got two secret worlds</line>

<line>to break into...</line>

<line>gays and the history of the department.</line>

<line>You know about Russo's Raiders?</line>

<line>Heard stories.</line>

<line>Captain John Russo had an elite squad.</line>

<line>They took care of businesses...</line>

<line>payoffs, raids.</line>

<line>Probably gay bashing, too.</line>

<line>Nice.</line>

<line>So, how do we find out
what cops were on this raid?</line>

<line>Not from the records, Lil.</line>

<line>That stuff was off the books.</line>

<line>How do we find out if Danny was beaten</line>

<line>with a nightstick, and not a bat?</line>

<line>We should stop calling them drag queens.</line>

<line>How come?</line>

<line>I think the last guy was offended.</line>

<line>I thought they call themselves
drag queens.</line>

<line>Don't mean we can.</line>

<line>Is it a slur? I don't think it is.</line>

<line>How about cross-dresser?</line>

<line>That's not offensive, right?</line>

<line>No, it's neutral.</line>

<line>All right, let's go with that one
this time.</line>

<line>Hey, how's it going?</line>

<line>Super.</line>

<line>We're, uh,</line>

<line>looking for an older gentlemen...</line>

a cross-dresser
<line>who goes by the name of Tinkerbell.</line>

<line>Don't know him.</line>

<line>You got any old-timers that hang out here?</line>

<line>There's an older crowd
in the rooms upstairs.</line>

<line>What rooms?</line>

<line>The conversation rooms.</line>

<line>Hell, we're not vice.</line>

<line>We don't care about your rooms.</line>

<line>We're looking for a witness.</line>

<line>Go on up.</line>

<line>Just watch your body language</line>

<line>if you don't wanna get groped.</line>

<line>Danny's mom said</line>

<line>you two dated in college.</line>

<line>Mmm. I found about Danny the hard way.</line>

<line>I caught him and Hank kissing.</line>

<line>Damn you.</line>

<line>Damn you.</line>

<line>I'm sorry.</line>

<line>Everything's a big lie.</line>

<line>You're just a liar, using me?</line>

<line>No. I love you.</line>

<line>Nothing has to change.</line>

<line>What do you mean?</line>

<line>I mean, I do love you.</line>

<line>I love you.</line>

<line>But, not the way you're supposed to.</line>

<line>Tell me.</line>

<line>Not as much.</line>

<line>As much as what?</line>

<line>As I love him.</line>

<line>Did you k*ll him?</line>

<line>I mean, that would solve our case.</line>

<line>No, we became friends.</line>

<line>Oh. Gotta run.</line>

<line>Uh, can we walk with you?</line>

<line>Do you know how to deliver a baby?</line>

<line>I can learn anything.</line>

<line>You know, I always wondered</line>

<line>if it was just a random street thing.</line>

<line>Something really bad was happening
in his life.</line>

<line>Like what?</line>

<line>I think Danny was being blackmailed.</line>

<line>He needed a chunk of money,
and obviously</line>

<line>he hadn't gotten a girl in trouble,</line>

<line>as we used to say.</line>

<line>But then I think,</line>

<line>why would anyone blackmail Danny?</line>

<line>He didn't have a cent.</line>

<line>He borrowed toothpaste.</line>

<line>Oops, last warning.</line>

<line>Um, did you know his boyfriend?</line>

<line>Hank? Mmm.</line>

<line>Ambitious, "Master of the Universe" type.</line>

<line>Law student.</line>

<line>What's Hank's last name?</line>

<line>Hank... oh...</line>

<line>What's the screwdriver?</line>

<line>Phillips?</line>

<line>Hank Phillips.</line>

<line>I don't know what became of him.</line>

<line>Danny didn't deserve what happened to him.</line>

<line>And even though I'm the one who got</line>

<line>her heart broken...</line>

<line>Danny wasn't cruel.</line>

<line>The world was.</line>

<line>The story is Tinkerbell had a nipple ring.</line>

<line>Way ahead of his time with that.</line>

<line>Anyway, in one of his many a*s kickings,</line>

<line>a guy took a knife</line>

<line>and tried to slice that ring right off.</line>

<line>But there's a happy ending.</line>

<line>Tink got the nipple reconstructed for free</line>

<line>at the VA hospital.</line>

<line>A doc there wrote it up as a combat wound</line>

<line>she got fighting in Korea.</line>

<line>So, Tinkerbell was in the Army?</line>

<line>You know this doc's name?</line>

<line>Or Tinkerbell's?</line>

<line>But that old queen sure got beaten up a lot.</line>

<line>Someone at the VA may know her real name.</line>

<line>Thanks for your time.</line>

<line>Thanks for this.</line>

<line>What do you got?</line>

<line>A question I need answered.</line>

<line>Quietly.</line>

<line>The case is from .</line>

<line>We need to know about a w*apon.</line>

<line>Oh, no problem.</line>

<line>Oh, this is Shelly.</line>

<line>She's gonna do that research for us.</line>

<line>On the QT?</line>

<line>Mum's the word.</line>

<line>Thanks.</line>

<line>Vera should be finding true love
right about now.</line>

<line>Back in ' ,</line>

<line>Tinkerbell came forward voluntarily.</line>

<line>Wanted to talk about being assaulted.</line>

<line>Tinkerbell's not a joke.</line>

<line>So far she's our most promising lead.</line>

<line>I got another one...</line>

<line>from the law school alumni office.</line>

<line>You found Hank?</line>

<line>Oh, yeah. Still lives in Philly.</line>

<line>Henry Phillips.</line>

<line>That Henry Phillips?</line>

<line>Your Honor. Detective Rush, Homicide.</line>

<line>I'm here on a personal matter.</line>

<line>A personal matter of yours?</line>

<line>Of yours.</line>

<line>I've reopened the Daniel Holtz case.</line>

<line>You and he were both at Penn in .</line>

<line>You remember him?</line>

<line>He was m*rder*d.</line>

<line>I understand you were close friends.</line>

<line>I'm not sure I can get into this.</line>

<line>I have no interest in prying into
your personal life.</line>

<line>I'm just trying to solve a homicide.</line>

<line>We're looking into the theory
it was a hate crime.</line>

<line>A gay bashing.</line>

<line>Who brought that theory to the table?</line>

<line>His mother.</line>

<line>I don't remember him well enough to help you.</line>

<line>Well, take my card</line>

<line>in case something jogs your memory.</line>

<line>Like the fact that you cared about him.</line>

<line>I don't talk publicly</line>

<line>about... these things.</line>

<line>I understand.</line>

<line>I'd like to help you.</line>

<line>But I need assurances...</line>

<line>It's between you and me.</line>

<line>No notes.</line>

<line>What do you wanna know?</line>

<line>Was Danny being blackmailed?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>His friend Deborah</line>

<line>said he needed money all of a sudden.</line>

<line>He wasn't being blackmailed. I was.</line>

<line>By who?</line>

<line>The management</line>

<line>at a certain bar.</line>

<line>The Hush Room.</line>

<line>I went to that rat hole with Danny twice,</line>

<line>and almost had my life ruined.</line>

<line>They were running an extortion scam
out of there.</line>

<line>And a young law student</line>

<line>was a good target.</line>

<line>You couldn't be a lawyer
if you were gay back then.</line>

<line>Moral turpitude.</line>

<line>So, why was Danny trying to get money</line>

<line>if you were the one blackmailed?</line>

<line>He felt responsible.</line>

<line>He was responsible.</line>

<line>I didn't mind being behind closed doors,</line>

<line>but Danny wanted to be out, on a scene.</line>

<line>That make you angry?</line>

<line>You think I k*lled him?</line>

<line>In a disgusting alley...
as a career move?</line>

<line>Not my best theory.</line>

<line>You know who really hated Danny?</line>

<line>His teammates on the baseball team.</line>

<line>Hey, these yours?</line>

<line>I know this place.</line>

<line>You do?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Do you go there?</line>

<line>I may have, yeah.</line>

<line>f*gg*t.</line>

<line>From that day on,</line>

<line>they made things really bad for him.</line>

<line>Beaned him on purpose.</line>

<line>Wouldn't sit with him on the bus.</line>

<line>He ended up quitting.</line>

<line>But, in these days,
there was no such thing</line>

as a gay athlete,
<line>not at Penn or anywhere else.</line>

<line>Thank you</line>

<line>for talking to me.</line>

<line>I need it to stay confidential.</line>

<line>There's one person</line>

<line>I'd like to tell about our conversation.</line>

<line>Danny's Mom's in town.</line>

<line>She'd like to hear from you.</line>

<line>I hear you're running a dice game</line>

<line>out of your warehouse, Anthony.</line>

<line>Dice game. What?</line>

<line>Yeah. I heard Bingo, dogfights.</line>

<line>Oh, all kinds of things to write you up on.</line>

<line>Come on, you guys what do you want with me?</line>

<line>Tell us about</line>

<line>the extortion scam.</line>

<line>Extortion? Why would we do that?</line>

<line>You tell us.</line>

<line>We was printing money,</line>

<line>selling watered-down drinks to the q*eers,</line>

<line>and it'd be bad for business.</line>

<line>Talk about bad for business...</line>

<line>how much, uh,
you charge for the dice game?</line>

<line>Ah, come on.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>My moron cousin hid a camera,</line>

<line>tried to hit up a couple of guys,</line>

<line>looked like they had something to lose.</line>

<line>My uncle almost ripped his throat out</line>

<line>when he found out.</line>

<line>For the reasons I cited above.</line>

<line>Bad for business.</line>

<line>My uncle shut him down.</line>

<line>End of story.</line>

<line>Believe me,</line>

<line>my cousin was way too small-time to
plan a m*rder.</line>

<line>The raid that night... I need a name.</line>

<line>They taped over their name tags.</line>

<line>You usually got warning.
Who gave it to you?</line>

<line>The bagman for the District Captain.</line>

<line>The guy who picked up</line>

<line>the payoff envelopes?</line>

<line>Contributions</line>

<line>to the police Athletic Foundation.</line>

<line>His name.</line>

<line>He was a rookie.</line>

<line>Nelson.</line>

<line>Was Officer Nelson</line>

<line>at the bar the night Danny was k*lled?</line>

<line>He was always there.</line>

<line>That's very helpful, Anthony.</line>

<line>No. This is not a put-on.</line>

<line>He went by the name Tinkerbell.</line>

<line>A Korean w*r vet.</line>

<line>His chest area got</line>

<line>in a little accident with a knife.</line>

<line>guys named Nelson on the job
in the ' s.</line>

<line>So we track them all down.</line>

<line>Yeah, yeah.</line>

<line>A cross-dresser. Had a nipple ring.</line>

<line>The Penn baseball team?</line>

<line>Yeah?</line>

<line>They were in Ithaca, New York</line>

<line>the weekend of your m*rder.</line>

<line>An away game.</line>

<line>The entire lineup.</line>

<line>You look that up?</line>

<line>I happen to have every
sports record known to man.</line>

<line>Memorized.</line>

<line>less guys you got to check out.</line>

<line>We have so many other suspects,
it's sad.</line>

<line>Blackmail ring, rogue cops,
neighborhood thugs...</line>

<line>No shortage of people</line>

<line>who had it in for a gay kid.</line>

<line>I got the results you asked for.</line>

<line>He's okay.</line>

<line>Oh, thanks.</line>

<line>I called in a favor at the FBI lab.</line>

<line>We used a pig's head to simulate
the bruise and wound pattern</line>

<line>for the w*apon, and then compared that</line>

<line>to the victim photographs.</line>

<line>And?</line>

<line>And that kid was not</line>

<line>k*lled with a nighstick.</line>

<line>Well, that's a relief.</line>

<line>Thanks.</line>

<line>Thank the pig.</line>

<line>What's your guess about the w*apon?</line>

<line>My money's on the classic baseball bat.</line>

<line>Thanks.</line>

<line>I found Tinkerbell.</line>

<line>Real name... George Polk.</line>

<line>Mr. Polk?</line>

<line>George Polk?</line>

<line>Detective Rush, Philadelphia Police.</line>

<line>Go away.</line>



<line>I'm here about the m*rder</line>

<line>of Daniel Holtz outside the Hush Room.</line>

<line>You wanted to give a statement to police.</line>

<line>I'm here to take it.</line>

<line>It took you a while to get back to me.</line>

<line>Yes, it did.</line>

<line>Decided to get dressed up?</line>

<line>Yes, I did.</line>

<line>You know, in my day, I was beaten up</line>

<line>by every cop and f*g basher</line>

<line>in South Philly.</line>

<line>Hmm. Cops beat you up for no reason?</line>

<line>The reason, young man, was hatred.</line>

<line>And career advancement.</line>

<line>Now, Captain Russo</line>

<line>loved his f*g-bashing.</line>

<line>We can only speculate why.</line>

<line>These are mug sh*ts</line>

<line>from the early ' s.</line>

<line>Arrests out of the Third District.</line>

<line>Is there a magnifier?</line>

<line>Yes.</line>

<line>Thank you.</line>

<line>These are old eyes,</line>

<line>you know, they need help.</line>

<line>Can I ask you something?</line>

<line>Please.</line>

<line>Why did you flaunt the way you were</line>

<line>if you knew people were gonna attack you for it?</line>

<line>You're a homicide detective?</line>

<line>He's new.</line>

<line>With what you see</line>

<line>people do, you get upset 'bout
how a man dresses,</line>

<line>and who he loves?</line>

<line>I ain't upset.</line>

<line>I'm just wondering, if you're getting</line>

<line>beaten up 'cause you dress like a woman,</line>

<line>and you don't wanna get beat up,</line>

<line>why not stop dressing like a woman?</line>

'<line>Cause I was never a practical girl.</line>

<line>Oh, he's one of them.</line>

<line>One of who?</line>

<line>The local monster.</line>

<line>I remember his eyebrows.</line>

<line>He was the ringleader.</line>

<line>What do you remember him doing?</line>

<line>I remember him hitting me and kicking me</line>

<line>and throwing things.</line>

<line>You're sure about him?</line>

<line>I'm sure. His mother would egg him on</line>

<line>from the window of their little slum.</line>

<line>And his name</line>

<line>is Brian.</line>

<line>Timmy O'Brien.</line>

<line>Lived around the corner</line>

<line>from the Hush Room.</line>

<line>Uh-huh.</line>

<line>Fourth floor window, right?</line>

<line>Apartment .</line>

<line>If the local thugs</line>

<line>did in that poor boy,</line>

<line>this one was a part of it.</line>

<line>Thank you, Mr. Polk.</line>

<line>That Danny was a good one.</line>

<line>Lot of spunk.</line>

<line>But heartbroken</line>

<line>because the Phillies did something
with a pennant.</line>

<line>They blew the pennant race in ' .</line>

<line>That was it.</line>

<line>That boy was thrown off of
the baseball team.</line>

<line>And he was always trying</line>

<line>to organize a game at the bar.</line>

<line>I was going to be</line>

<line>a cheerleader.</line>

<line>I get the vapors just thinking about it.</line>

<line>Whoa.</line>

<line>You, uh, Timmy O'Brien?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>What's it about?</line>

<line>Just, uh, following up a dog call</line>

<line>from a long time ago.</line>

<line>All right.</line>

<line>You recognize this individual?</line>

<line>Maybe.</line>

<line>Ever get on her case?</line>

<line>Her?</line>

<line>Word is, you took care of business</line>

<line>with the local drag queens.</line>

<line>I didn't ask them to come to
my neighborhood,</line>

<line>start parading around on the streets.</line>

<line>I hear you.</line>

<line>But I never hurt nobody.</line>

<line>I'm just carrying out a duty here.</line>

<line>So, uh,</line>

<line>what did you do to these fine citizens?</line>

<line>Kid stuff.</line>

<line>You know, harassing them, like.</line>

<line>Throwing stuff.</line>

<line>Bottles, sticks?</line>

<line>Chinese takeout.</line>

<line>How's that work?</line>

<line>Well, when we had some leftovers,</line>

<line>see a couple of f*gs on our street,</line>

<line>we'd dump the food on them.</line>

<line>What's that,</line>

<line>as*ault with a deadly egg roll?</line>

<line>Did you ever see this kid?</line>

<line>Nah.</line>

'<line>Cause he was a local f*g.</line>

<line>I don't recognize him.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>I ain't proud of all that stuff.</line>

<line>I wouldn't want my kids to know I did it.</line>

<line>It was just pranks.</line>

<line>Have a good day.</line>

<line>Your Honor.</line>

<line>Thanks for letting me know.</line>

<line>Yeah, I wanted to meet her.</line>

<line>The hotel said she was brought here
last night.</line>

<line>Mm. How's she doing?</line>

<line>Have you gone in?</line>

<line>No. I was nervous.</line>

<line>A grown man, and I'm scared to meet his mom.</line>

<line>So I'll go with you.</line>

<line>Helen, this is Hank.</line>

<line>You're the boy who ran out of the room.</line>

<line>I guess so.</line>

<line>Hank.</line>

<line>Any progress?</line>

<line>We've got at least</line>

<line>one person of interest.</line>

<line>Who's that?</line>

<line>Local thug in the neighborhood.</line>

<line>Told a story about throwing
Chinese leftovers</line>

<line>at gay men out on the street.</line>

<line>You talked to that man?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>You wanted to know about Danny.</line>

<line>In many ways, Danny was a man of his time.</line>

<line>He lied about his life to some people.</line>

<line>To you.</line>

<line>In other ways,</line>

<line>Danny was ahead of his time.</line>

<line>How?</line>

<line>He didn't hate himself.</line>

<line>Somehow, he knew</line>

<line>he had a right to exist.</line>

<line>You haven't told them, have you?</line>

<line>My parents? You crazy?</line>

<line>No way, huh?</line>

<line>If they even suspected I was rooting</line>

<line>for the Phillies against the Braves,</line>

<line>I'd be dead to them.</line>

<line>I could never go home again.</line>

<line>Hey, guys... ladies.</line>

<line>How's it goin'?</line>

<line>Here's a little Chinese for you.</line>

<line>I hear f*ggots like Chinese food.</line>

<line>Hey!</line>

<line>Forget it.</line>

<line>No, I wanna see their faces.</line>

<line>Officer...</line>

<line>Come on, Danny.</line>

<line>Officer.</line>

<line>Danny was brave.</line>

<line>I wasn't.</line>

<line>What happened</line>

<line>after the Chinese food?</line>

<line>I went home, uh...</line>

<line>Danny came over later,</line>

<line>and we fought.</line>

<line>He stormed out...
obviously went to the Hush Room,</line>

<line>and... and I never saw him again.</line>

<line>Do you know the name of the officer
he spoke to?</line>

<line>I have the paperwork.</line>

<line>Danny threw it at me that night,</line>

<line>called me a coward.</line>

<line>You kept it?</line>

<line>Anything I had of his, I kept.</line>

<line>You loved him.</line>

<line>Yes.</line>

<line>I'm glad.</line>

<line>Officer Paul Nelson took the report.</line>

<line>Nelson... same name Anthony gave us.</line>

<line>In ' , he was a rookie
in the Third District.</line>

<line>He worked under the command of
Captain John Russo.</line>

<line>A Russo's Raider.</line>

<line>He booked the city</line>

<line>when he retired. Lives out in Alden.</line>

<line>Works at the cop shop</line>

<line>at the union hall.</line>

<line>Go pay him a visit.</line>

<line>Paul Nelson?</line>

<line>Yes?</line>

<line>Lilly Rush, Homicide.</line>

<line>Scotty Valens, same.</line>

<line>What can I do for you?</line>

<line>You took a complaint of harassment</line>

<line>from a Daniel Holtz in .</line>

<line>Neighborhood boys</line>

<line>threw food at them.</line>

<line>This kid was m*rder*d the same night.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Wanna tell us what you know?</line>

<line>I knew this day would come.</line>

<line>Let's meet tomorrow.</line>

<line>That kid Danny had moxie,</line>

<line>coming to me with the noodles droppin'
from his forehead.</line>

<line>I asked him if he was the shortstop</line>

<line>on the Penn baseball team,</line>

<line>'cause I recognize him.</line>

<line>I went to some of them games.</line>

<line>You talked about baseball
at a time like that?</line>

<line>I was embarrassed.</line>

<line>Embarrassed because he was a f*g</line>

<line>and you had to talk to him?</line>

<line>I thought</line>

<line>the whole situation was embarrassing.</line>

<line>How old were you?</line>

<line>Twenty-two.</line>

<line>I just started on the job.</line>

<line>I thought, I'm set.</line>

<line>Next thing you know,
I'm John Russo's bagman.</line>

<line>That didn't sit right with you?</line>

<line>Oh, I loved it at first.</line>

<line>It was like going behind the curtain</line>

<line>in the Wizard of Oz...</line>

<line>see how the whole thing works.</line>

<line>And the night of Danny's m*rder...</line>

<line>how'd it work then?</line>

<line>I took the kid's report. That's it.</line>

<line>Then they called a raid</line>

<line>that night... late...</line>

<line>and I saw him again.</line>

<line>♪ When you're young and so in love as we ♪</line>

<line>♪ And bewildered by the world we see ♪</line>

<line>♪ Why do people hurt us so? ♪</line>

<line>♪ Only those in love would know ♪</line>

<line>♪ What a town without pity can do...♪</line>

<line>Next time I saw him, he was dead.</line>

<line>You know what, Nelson?</line>

<line>That's the part I'm not buying.</line>

<line>I don't need to be talking to you.</line>

<line>But you are. Why?</line>

<line>You feel guilty about something?</line>

<line>I'm telling you what I know.</line>

<line>Me and My partner chased a patron
to the alley.</line>

<line>We saw the kid's body</line>

<line>splayed and protruding from the alley.</line>

"<line>Splayed and protruding."</line>

<line>That's what the caller said.</line>

<line>You made that anonymous call.</line>

<line>Don't do this to me.</line>

<line>Look... we're all cops here.</line>

<line>It'll be handled right.</line>

<line>A cop didn't do this.</line>

<line>Forensics says it was a cop.</line>

<line>w*apon was a nightstick.</line>

<line>That's wrong.</line>

<line>It's what the lab says.</line>

<line>Absolutely wrong.</line>

<line>Which you know</line>

<line>is true, because you were there.</line>

<line>You saw what happened.
- I didn't see...</line>

<line>all of it.</line>

<line>You walked away?</line>

<line>I didn't know</line>

<line>He was going to die.</line>

<line>They were beating on him, and...</line>

<line>yeah...</line>

<line>We looked the other way.</line>

<line>Who were they?</line>

<line>Some guys I knew in the neighborhood.</line>

<line>Names.</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>You can't not know.</line>

<line>It's what you're here for.</line>

<line>I wanna show you something.</line>

<line>That's my son</line>

<line>and his partner.</line>

<line>He thinks</line>

<line>his old man is a good guy.</line>

<line>Which one's your son?</line>

<line>So do it for him.</line>

<line>Be a good guy.</line>

<line>Hi, Timmy.</line>

<line>Paul Nelson.</line>

<line>Your brother John's friend.</line>

<line>Yeah. It's been, like... ten years...</line>

<line>Since your dad's wake.</line>

<line>What are you doing here?</line>

<line>He's here giving you up, Timmy.</line>

<line>You're goin' down for the m*rder</line>

<line>of Daniel Holtz in .</line>

<line>Paul...</line>

<line>Sorry.</line>

<line>Paul, you can't... No, you...</line>

<line>You gotta tell'em what happened.</line>

<line>You gotta tell'em what you really saw.</line>

<line>It was self-defense.</line>

<line>You gonna lie</line>

<line>or are you going to tell the truth?</line>

<line>I'm gonna tell the truth, Timmy.</line>

<line>Where do you come from, sweetheart?</line>

<line>You better start running.</line>

<line>f*gg*t.</line>

<line>Run, run, f*gg*t.</line>

<line>Run, fancyboy</line>

<line>Keep running.</line>

<line>Keep going.</line>

<line>What are you stopping for?</line>

<line>What are you gonna do?</line>

<line>Come here.</line>
