<line>Can't?</line>

<line>Can't is not in your vocabulary.</line>

<line>Private Kasher?</line>

<line>Private Kasher!</line>

<line>Private kasher?</line>

<line>The tenth time you checked that thing.</line>

<line>Oh, she was supposed to call at : .</line>

<line>Elisa.</line>

<line>It's : .
- Well, she's seven minutes late.</line>

<line>That a regular thing?</line>

<line>Elisa calling in?
- No, no. It's a...</line>

<line>Yeah. I mean...</line>

she was doing so good,
<line>and then I don't know.</line>

<line>I don't know what's happening.</line>

<line>Where were you?</line>

<line>Lil, questioned documents kicked
this one over.</line>

<line>Want us to take a look.
- Cold job?</line>

<line>Doesn't match any live ones.</line>

<line>It was mailed anonymously into homicide.</line>

<line>Letterhead's from the Wilkes
military academy for boys.</line>

<line>The boot camp boarding school
in Roxborough?</line>

<line>Mm-hmm. State run,
scared straight central.</line>

<line>Parents who can't control their
bad boys, dump them there.</line>

<line>What is it?
- Some kind of list.</line>

"<line>The plan."</line>

"<line>Number one: Ignore."</line>

"<line>Number two: Reward."
"Number three: Secret."</line>

"<line>Number four: Test."
"Number five: Escalate."</line>

"<line>Six..."</line>

"<line>Destroy."</line>

<line>What the hell.</line>

<line>It could be some kind of shorthand?</line>

<line>Question is, what for?</line>

<line>Mailed into homicide.
What else?</line>

<line>Documents went over it?
- No fingerprints.</line>

<line>Sender didn't even spit on the seal.</line>

"<line>May , ."</line>

<line>- "Nash."
- Well, maybe Nash is the writer.</line>

<line>Or the victim.</line>

<line>So the doer's feeling the guilt.
Mails it in.</line>

<line>Or some bystander finds it.</line>

<line>Wants to do the right thing.</line>

<line>It could be a frame job.</line>

<line>Why send it five years after the fact?</line>

<line>The problem is we got no murders</line>

<line>under hundred some years Wilkes
military academy's been around.</line>

<line>No body with a Nash toe tag...</line>

<line>It wasn't classified as a homicide.</line>

"<line>Accidental death.
Wilkes military academy, may , .</line>

<line>Nash cavanaugh. years old."</line>

<line>Hmm... drowning.</line>

<line>Guy was liquored up good.</line>

<line>Blood alcohol content . .</line>

<line>Questioned documents took
a s*ab at who sent this "plan" in?</line>

<line>Handwriting analysis suggests
a kid wrote it.</line>

<line>Other than that, we got nothing.</line>

<line>A night duty sergeant,
James Creighton, found the body.</line>

<line>Maybe we start with him.</line>

<line>Cavanaugh's death was
classified as accidental.</line>

<line>We conducted our own investigation.</line>

<line>And now, we're conducting ours.</line>

<line>Well, sergeant Creighton was the duty
sergeant on rounds that night.</line>

<line>Tell them what you know, Creighton.
- Sir, yes, sir.</line>

<line>I found lieutenant Cavanaugh at : .</line>

<line>negative vital signs, no response to CPR.</line>

<line>Creighton was in Iraq.</line>

<line>Earned the bronze star.</line>

<line>Ever seen this, colonel?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>How about you, sergeant Creighton?</line>

<line>I never seen that, ma'am.</line>

<line>Ignore, reward, secret, test,
escalate, destroy...</line>

- that mean anything to you, colonel?
<line>Nothing at all.</line>

<line>Were you aware that Nash
was a drinker, colonel?</line>

<line>It never interfered with his duties here.</line>

<line>The lieutenant was respected.</line>

<line>Knew how to deal with slop.</line>

<line>Slop?</line>

<line>The kids who come here.</line>

<line>Drug addicts, hoodlums,
cons in the making.</line>

<line>Nash turned slop into men.</line>

"<line>Can't" is not in your vocabulary!</line>

<line>Failure is not an option, private Kasher.</line>

<line>Do you understand me?</line>

<line>seconds!</line>

, , ,

, , ...

<line>Private Kasher?</line>

<line>Private?</line>

<line>Is there a problem here, lieutenant?</line>

<line>No, sir.</line>

<line>Then carry on.</line>

<line>Private Lasalle, get him out of here.</line>

<line>Dismissed!</line>

<line>Passed.</line>

<line>But I didn't do , sir.</line>

<line>You never will.</line>

<line>Please, just give me
one more chance, sir, please...</line>

<line>I can do it.
I know I can, sir! Please!</line>

<line>One more chance, sir.</line>

<line>Please, I can do it.</line>

<line>I know I can.</line>

<line>Please, sir.</line>

"<line>From the child, comes forth the soldier."</line>

<line>Cavanaugh made that happen.</line>

<line>By almost drowning a child?</line>

<line>Private Jerry kasher was and
always will be a bad seed.</line>

<line>Not even Cavanaugh could change that.</line>

<line>This private Kasher,
he ever make any threats on Nash?</line>

<line>No. But he threatened other cadets.</line>

<line>How?
- Torching their bunks...</line>

<line>with them in it.</line>

<line>Private Kasher's got some hours
to walk off before graduation.</line>

<line>Private Kasher!</line>

<line>Walk off?
- Tour of punishment.</line>

<line>Front and center!</line>

<line>You need some weaponry ,
private? / No, sir.</line>

<line>Detective Rush, Valens.
Philadelphia homicide.</line>

<line>These people are here to ask you
some questions.</line>

<line>Answer them.</line>

<line>Gung-ho jarhead.</line>

<line>We're here about Nash cavanaugh.</line>

<line>Gung-ho jarhead number two.</line>

<line>We hear you had a beef with him
in swimming class.</line>

<line>Almost drowned you.</line>

<line>Guy just wanted me to be all
that I could be.</line>

<line>Got you pretty pissed off.
- Just enough to k*ll him?</line>

<line>That's not how it was.</line>

<line>I just wanted another chance.</line>

<line>I can do it, sir.</line>

<line>One minute, sir.</line>

<line>I can do it. Look.</line>

<line>Go.</line>

<line>Time.</line>

<line>Didn't think you had it in you, buddy.</line>

<line>You proved me wrong.</line>

<line>For that, you get the prize.</line>

<line>What was the prize?</line>

<line>His respect.</line>

<line>Nash was proud of me.</line>

<line>That was important to you.
Him being proud of you?</line>

<line>Only time anyone ever was.</line>

<line>So what changed?</line>

<line>With what?
- With you.</line>

<line>Nothing.</line>

<line>Nothing changed.</line>

<line>My folks, uh, mailed me one way,
parcel post,</line>

<line>No return address to this armpit.</line>

<line>I was always trouble.</line>

<line>Kid's gone to the dark side.</line>

<line>But back in the day, it sounds like
he kind of worshipped Nash.</line>

<line>Didn't hate him.</line>

<line>Well, maybe Nash had other enemies?</line>

<line>Could be.
Guy was a hard a*s.</line>

<line>Got a hold of private Kasher's
medical records.</line>

<line>Might shine a different light.</line>

<line>Few months prior to Nash's death,
multiple visits to the infirmary.</line>

<line>Kid was throwing up drunk.</line>

<line>Drunk? He was years old.</line>

<line>Half the academy's students enter the
school with drug and alcohol problems.</line>

<line>The place is on / lock-down.
No way those kids could get booze.</line>

<line>But an adult could.</line>

<line>And we know who our resident
drinker on campus was.</line>

<line>Nash cavanaugh.</line>

<line>Where'd you get the alcohol, Jerry?</line>

<line>Boozehound Nash,
he ever pass on the love?</line>

<line>What do you mean?</line>

<line>Where'd you get the booze? / Maybe
you were sipping a nip from the Nash stash?</line>

<line>That the real reason you were
trying to get in good with him?</line>

<line>He gave it to me!
I never asked for it!</line>

<line>That was the prize.</line>

<line>Didn't mean to scare you, buddy.</line>

<line>Yes, sir.</line>

<line>I mean, no, sir.</line>

<line>I'm not scared.
- Of course, you're not.</line>

<line>For what you did today.</line>

<line>Your reward.
- Sir?</line>

<line>You're a man now.</line>

<line>You made me proud, being
a winner out there.</line>

<line>You pass go.</line>

<line>Collect your reward.
Drink up.</line>

<line>Not just anyone gets this reward.</line>

<line>I save it for the winners.</line>

<line>For my special boys like you, Jerry.</line>

<line>Thank you.</line>

<line>I mean it. Sir.</line>

<line>Let's keep this our secret, okay, buddy?</line>

<line>Just you and me.</line>

<line>Sir, yes, sir.</line>

<line>Our secret.</line>

<line>Your secret?</line>

<line>Ignore... reward...</line>

<line>secret.</line>

<line>It's the plan.</line>

<line>Nash ignored you in the pool.</line>

<line>Rewarded you with the booze.</line>

<line>Made you keep a secret.</line>

<line>What other secrets did he make you keep?</line>

<line>Drawing you in,
keeping things quiet...why?</line>

<line>What kind of secrets do
a year old man and a boy have?</line>

<line>It wasn't a m*rder*r's plan, was it?</line>

<line>It was a pedophile's... / He deserved
to die for what he did to me!</line>

<line>Sit down!</line>

<line>I did it! I k*lled him!</line>

<line>You k*lled him.
- Yeah!</line>

<line>I k*lled that sick pervert.</line>

<line>By yourself.
- I did it!</line>

<line>Did you write the plan?
- Yes!</line>

<line>What'd you do with it?</line>

<line>Answer us.
What did you do with the plan?</line>

<line>Ripped it up.</line>

<line>Threw it away.</line>

<line>That a fact.</line>

<line>If Jerry didn't send us the plan,
then who did?</line>

<line>He confessed to the m*rder, Lil.
We got to call the D.A.</line>

<line>Nah, I don't buy it, boss.</line>

<line>The kid was an pound weakling in .</line>

<line>No way he drowned a pound
adult male on his own.</line>

<line>Won't change his story.
- At least now we got motive.</line>

<line>Victim was a pedophile with a plan.</line>

<line>For waging physiological warfare
on a year old boy.</line>

<line>Pedophiles are prolific.
Nash would've had other victims.</line>

<line>Maybe Jerry had an accomplice.</line>

<line>Academy's infirmary records.</line>

<line>Colonel gave them up without a warrant.
Real cooperative guy.</line>

<line>Elisa? What's wrong?</line>

<line>Medical records of th graders
in Nash's swim class, ,</line>

<line>same year as Jerry.</line>

<line>I check for symptoms of sexual abuse.</line>

<line>All I came up with was this.</line>

<line>Private RJ holden, reported by a night
duty sergeant for bed-wetting.</line>

<line>Started when he was
in Nash's swim class.</line>

<line>Bedwetting at age ?</line>

<line>Could've been a symptom of stress,
or sexual abuse.</line>

<line>Night duty sergeant reported it,
James Creighton.</line>

<line>Well, we'll go back to him,
see if he knows about RJ.</line>

<line>I got to...</line>

<line>I got to go.</line>

<line>Yeah. Yeah, sure.</line>

<line>Uh, hey, I, I'm sorry, boss.
- Just go, Scotty.</line>

<line>How long has Elisa been out
of the hospital?</line>

<line>A month, two.</line>

<line>The six P's,
and don't you ever forget them.</line>

"<line>Prior preparation prevents
piss poor performance!"</line>

<line>Grandma's slow, but she's old!</line>

<line>Sergeant Creighton?</line>

<line>Lieutenant Stillman, philadelphia homicide.</line>

<line>Sir.
- Sergeant.</line>

<line>We're here about cadet RJ holden.</line>

<line>The bedwetting report you filed
when he was .</line>

<line>Yes, ma'am. I surely remember that.</line>

<line>Sergeant, what was the nature of RJ's
relationship with Nash cavanaugh?</line>

<line>Relationship, sir?</line>

<line>Lieutenant Cavanaugh abused
at least one boy at this school.</line>

<line>Sexually.</line>

<line>Did you know about that, sergeant?</line>

<line>No, ma'am, I did not.</line>

<line>Did you ever talk to RJ
about the bed-wetting problem?</line>

<line>It's not my duty to talk
about the problem, sir.</line>

<line>Then what was your duty, sergeant?</line>

<line>To end it.</line>

<line>Piss the sheets,
you walk the yard, private.</line>

<line>Don't you go all crybaby on me now.
Do I look like your mama, private?</line>

<line>He grabbed me.</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>He grabbed me.
- What are you talking about?</line>

<line>Lieutenant Cavanaugh...</line>

<line>he grabbed my... my thing.</line>

<line>Are you a f*gg*t?
- Sir?</line>

<line>Are you a f*gg*t?
- No, sir.</line>

<line>I asked you a direct question,
I expect a direct answer, private.</line>

<line>Are you or are you not a f*gg*t?</line>

<line>I am not a f*gg*t, sir.</line>

<line>So we don't have a problem then,
do we, private Holden?</line>

<line>No, sir.</line>

<line>Disciplining the plebes was my job.
I did what I thought was best.</line>

<line>Disciplining them?</line>

<line>Sergeant, RJ was a year old boy
asking for help.</line>

<line>Is that the approach that earned you
the bronze star?</line>

<line>These boys are liars,
cheats and drunks.</line>

<line>Slop, sir. Just like I was
when I came here as a boy.</line>

<line>The bronze star, sir?</line>

<line>The academy earned that.</line>

<line>Made me a man.</line>

<line>What Nash did to RJ,
did that make him a man, sergeant?</line>

<line>Elisa?</line>

<line>Elisa?</line>

<line>El?</line>

<line>The Giant Came Back</line>

<line>Can't say I remember that conversation
with sergeant Creighton.</line>

<line>Sorry, ma'am.</line>

<line>You told him that lieutenant
Cavanaugh touched you, RJ.</line>

<line>Like I said, don't recall the convo.</line>

<line>What about the bed-wetting?</line>

<line>You recall that, RJ?</line>

<line>Now that would be memorable.</line>

<line>Can't say I do, ma'am.</line>

<line>Your file's got the records.
- Then someone made a mistake.</line>

<line>I don't think so.</line>

<line>So blondes think now, ma'am?
- Watch your tone, son.</line>

<line>Best defense is a good offense, right, RJ?</line>

<line>Whatever, ma'am.</line>

<line>Take the focus off of you.</line>

<line>What Nash did to you.</line>

<line>RJ, we know about Jerry.</line>

<line>Jerry?</line>

<line>And what Nash did to him.</line>

<line>From this.
- "Ignore, reward, secret."</line>

<line>What can you tell us about number four?</line>

"<line>Test."
How'd he test you?</line>

<line>You were years old, RJ.</line>

<line>What Nash cavanaugh did to you was wrong.</line>

<line>I'll tell...</line>

<line>you.</line>

<line>All right.</line>

<line>Sit down, son.</line>

<line>I'm not a f*g.</line>

<line>It's all right, RJ.</line>

<line>I'm not a f*g.</line>

<line>Got to make sure you get in
some extra hours of practice.</line>

<line>Yes, sir.</line>

<line>Meet's coming up in a week.</line>

<line>And you are going to make the top ten
this time, buddy.</line>

<line>But we have got to keep this on the D.L.</line>

<line>We don't want anyone to think
I'm playing favorites here.</line>

<line>Sure.
I mean, yes, sir.</line>

<line>Just like the beer, this is our secret.</line>

<line>Just you and me.</line>

<line>You haven't told anyone about that,
have you?</line>

<line>No, sir.</line>

<line>Of course you haven't.</line>

<line>Or I would've heard.</line>

<line>You passed the test.</line>

<line>Keeping our secrets.</line>

<line>You got an A+, buddy.</line>

<line>You didn't think I was going to hurt you,
did you?</line>

<line>Of course you didn't.</line>

<line>Now give me a big smile.</line>

<line>Number four: Test.</line>

<line>Make sure they don't run...</line>

<line>and I didn't.</line>

<line>Tell me about number five.</line>

<line>Escalate.</line>

<line>He'd show me porn magazines.</line>

<line>Tell me,</line>

"you can touch yourself
<line>if you want. I won't tell."</line>

<line>He used them on other boys, too.</line>

<line>That's how me and...</line>

<line>You and Jerry?</line>

<line>I don't know any Jerry.
- Jerry kasher.</line>

<line>I don't know any Jerry.</line>

<line>You were in the same swim class.
- It was me, okay!</line>

<line>I drowned that son of a b*tch!
I k*lled Nash!</line>

<line>And I don't know any Jerry.</line>

<line>RJ says he doesn't know Jerry.</line>

<line>Jerry says he doesn't know RJ.</line>

<line>But both are confessing to the m*rder.</line>

<line>And neither of them seem to know
this plan was sent to us.</line>

<line>A school that size, boss,
these kids had to know each other.</line>

<line>Well enough to talk about sexual abuse?</line>

<line>Kids came from different worlds, Lil.</line>

<line>Popular athlete, loser outcast.
Nothing in common.</line>

<line>Except Nash's swim class.</line>

<line>Hey, handwriting's back.</line>

<line>Neither Jerry or RJ's matched the plan.
- So there was a boy number three?</line>

<line>Nash being Nash, no telling
how many boys wanted him dead.</line>

<line>Well, maybe this third kid holds the key
how Jerry and RJ are connected.</line>

<line>I'll lean on Jerry again.
Short fuse.</line>

<line>Guess who I just had a chat with?</line>

<line>Private RJ holden.</line>

<line>He told.</line>

<line>What're you talking about?</line>

<line>Number five: Escalate.</line>

<line>The magazines Nash used. No wonder
you wanted to k*ll him. I would, too.</line>

<line>RJ told you about that?
- Mm-hmm.</line>

<line>And that you, Jerry, were the ringleader.</line>

<line>He said you thought up the m*rder
all on your own...</line>

<line>It was Dominic's idea, not mine!</line>

<line>It was all Dominic!</line>

<line>Sit down.</line>

<line>Sit down.</line>

<line>So Dominic wrote the plan, huh?</line>

<line>How'd you guys find each other?</line>

<line>You were just kids, you know.</line>

<line>What happened...</line>

<line>It wasn't your fault.</line>

<line>He...</line>

<line>started with the drinks.</line>

<line>That was our secret.</line>

<line>Then came the night swims.</line>

<line>Then the magazines and other things.</line>

<line>And by that time, I'd kept so
many secrets I couldn't tell the truth.</line>

<line>Then tell the truth now.</line>

<line>Dominic...</line>

<line>was the only one of us who had guts.</line>

<line>How did Dominic find you and RJ?</line>

<line>I...</line>

<line>took one of Nash's magazines,</line>

<line>and showed it around.</line>

<line>You know, I didn't mean anything by it.
I just...</line>

<line>I wanted the other kids to like me.</line>

<line>Her boobs...</line>

<line>It's huge!</line>

<line>Like balloons.</line>

<line>Yo, I didn't see miss April yet!</line>

<line>You're ripping her booty, man!</line>

<line>What the hell.</line>

<line>That's when we knew.</line>

<line>And that's when you made the plan.</line>

<line>To do to Nash,</line>

<line>what he did to us.</line>

<line>Ignore,</line>

<line>reward,</line>

<line>secret,</line>

<line>test,</line>

<line>escalate...</line>

<line>destroy.</line>

<line>Dominic lasalle.</line>

<line>Also in Nash's swim class.</line>

<line>Lil, you take him in interview A.
You two split up Jerry and RJ.</line>

<line>I'm here as Dominic's guardian.</line>

<line>I'd like to observe.</line>

<line>John, show the colonel to observation,
please.</line>

<line>Not exactly chomping at the bit</line>

<line>to take down another kid,
especially when the guy deserved to die.</line>

<line>Amen. / We got our jobs to do, Lil.</line>

<line>Let's go.</line>

<line>Wish I had called in sick today.</line>

<line>Yeah, me, too.</line>

<line>Scotty, is she okay?</line>

<line>Uh, she's... gone.</line>

<line>What?
- She's not anywhere.</line>

<line>Not any of the places she goes
to when she gets... you know, like this.</line>

library, the park, her sister's.
<line>All day, I'm driving. I can't find her.</line>

<line>Scotty, call it in, get some help.</line>

<line>I can't call it in.
They'll make her go back,</line>

<line>and I promised her she'd,
she'd never have to go back. I promised. I...</line>

<line>I can't do that to her.</line>

<line>All right. It's going to be all right.
- Playing stickball on my block.</line>

<line>That's the first time I seen her.
years old.</line>

<line>Oh, man...</line>

<line>just kicking it on a hot summer night.</line>

<line>That's the only place Elisa ever felt...
normal, you know?</line>

<line>I got to find her.</line>

<line>Are you sure you want my handwriting?</line>

<line>Hmm?</line>

<line>Don't you want to play bad cop first?</line>

<line>Knock me around some?</line>

<line>Write.</line>

<line>I confess. I wrote the plan.</line>

<line>And you sent it to us.</line>

<line>Why?</line>

<line>Boredom.</line>



<line>Military environments thrive
on the cultivation of it.</line>

<line>Makes warfare that much more of a rush.</line>

<line>Really?
- You should know.</line>

<line>Dreary police academy drills.</line>

<line>Then you get to k*ll.</line>

<line>What a thrill.</line>

<line>I wouldn't know.</line>

<line>Maybe you will.</line>

<line>Like you do?</line>

<line>We k*lled that pervert.</line>

<line>We?
- Me and my two buddies.</line>

<line>What two buddies, Dominic?</line>

<line>Me, myself and I.</line>

<line>Your friends are putting the job on you.</line>

<line>Jerry, Dominic.</line>

<line>You want a deal, you better jump in fast.</line>

<line>Your wife still flog the bishop,</line>

<line>or did she stop doing that
a hundred years ago?</line>

<line>My wife's dead.</line>

<line>Nine years ago.</line>

<line>Tell me about the plan.</line>

<line>Dominic figured it out...</line>

<line>what Nash was doing.</line>

<line>His plan.</line>

<line>What he did to you at the pool, Jerry,
he did that to all of us.</line>

<line>It was like his plan all along.</line>

<line>I don't get it.
- Number one: Ignore.</line>

<line>He ignored us in different ways,
made us beg for attention.</line>

<line>Then he rewarded us.
- With the beer.</line>

<line>That was number two in his plan.
He made me keep it a secret.</line>

<line>Me, too.</line>

'<line>Cause it was number three:</line>

<line>Keeping secrets.</line>

<line>Then he made real sure
we never told on him.</line>

<line>I didn't. Did you?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Shh.</line>

<line>Kinda like a test.</line>

<line>Right.
Number four: Test.</line>

<line>Right.</line>

<line>Made sure we never told anyone</line>

<line>so he could do other things
and not get caught.</line>

<line>Like show us those magazines.</line>

<line>That was number five.</line>

<line>Escalate.
- What does that escalate mean?</line>

<line>To make things worse.</line>

<line>Then, the final thing... number six...</line>

<line>we know what that is.</line>

<line>You don't have to say it.</line>

<line>Number one: Ignore.</line>

<line>No one show up at swim class tomorrow.</line>

<line>We do to him, step by step,
exactly what he did to us.</line>

<line>So after you skipped out
on Nash's swim class, what happened?</line>

<line>Number two.</line>

<line>Whoever he came to first,</line>

<line>whoever he picked,</line>

<line>that kid would be the bait.
the reward.</line>

<line>I was just holding my breath.</line>

<line>Hoping it wouldn't be me.</line>

<line>Private Lasalle, why weren't you not in class?</line>

<line>I got busy.</line>

<line>Excuse me?</line>

<line>I said I got busy.</line>

<line>Wanna see what I got so busy with?</line>

<line>Got it for tonight.</line>

<line>For the pool.</line>

<line>Will you bring some beer, sir?</line>

<line>Number two: Reward.</line>

<line>You were it.</line>

<line>RJ and Jerry are talking.</line>

<line>Time's a wasting.</line>

<line>You're playing your hand badly,
detective Rush.</line>

<line>See, in poker, like business or warfare,</line>

<line>The optimal strategy is not to have one.</line>

<line>Or, rather, not to show it.</line>

<line>You wear yours like a bad dye job.</line>

<line>Game's over, Dominic.</line>

<line>You already confessed to the m*rder.</line>

<line>So there's something that happened
that night...</line>

<line>that you don't wanna give up.</line>

<line>I wonder what that is.</line>

<line>Number three: Secret.</line>

<line>What was the secret?</line>

<line>Dominic was gonna get Nash in the pool...</line>

<line>like he did to us.</line>

<line>Promise to do... things with him.</line>

<line>And then...</line>

<line>and then everything went wrong.</line>

<line>Ready to get in?</line>

<line>Nah.
I'm a little too tired, buddy.</line>

<line>Maybe some other time.</line>

<line>But...</line>

<line>but I got a secret.</line>

<line>A real good secret... for us... in the pool.</line>

<line>Like I said... maybe some other time.</line>

<line>So the plan fell apart.
Nash left.</line>

<line>No. He didn't.</line>

<line>You got him back in the pool?</line>

<line>How'd you do that?</line>

<line>How'd you do that, RJ?</line>

<line>How'd you get Nash into the pool, Jerry?</line>

<line>How'd you do it?</line>

<line>Dominic, whatever you had to do...</line>

<line>it wasn't your fault.</line>

<line>What you did...
- Number four: Test.</line>

<line>Make sure that he doesn't run.</line>

<line>But I can't let the plan fail.</line>

<line>So I beg him.</line>

"<line>Please," I said.</line>

"<line>Please."</line>

<line>Like I said, some other time.</line>

<line>Please?</line>

<line>Please?</line>

<line>Only if you smile.</line>

<line>Number six: Destroy.</line>

"<line>From the child, comes forth the soldier."</line>

<line>That's what he would say
when he was done.</line>

<line>And I would just go away in my mind.</line>

<line>Not this time.</line>

<line>Not this time.</line>

<line>From the child, comes forth the soldier.</line>

<line>Isn't that right, buddy?</line>

<line>Hey, what are you guys doing here?</line>

<line>Don't let your elbows touch the water,
private! seconds! Go!</line>

<line>Can't is not in your vocabulary, cadet!</line>

<line>Failure is not an option!</line>

<line>You're special, a real winner,
my special boy!</line>

<line>You like this, don't you!</line>

<line>Don't pretend you don't like it!</line>

<line>Destroy, destroy, destroy!</line>

<line>Somebody's coming.</line>

<line>They shouldn't go away for this.</line>

<line>Hmm. They confessed m*rder one.
What are you gonna do?</line>

<line>Maybe the guy slipped, fell,
and hit his head, boss.</line>

<line>I could see that.
- Accidental death.</line>

<line>My pen ran out in there,
didn't get that last part.</line>

<line>I think we could all use
a scotch right about now.</line>

<line>Anyone hear from Scotty?</line>

<line>Not me.</line>

<line>You sent it in, you frigging rat!</line>

<line>Hey, knock it off!</line>

<line>You frigging liar!</line>

<line>g*n!</line>

<line>Don't you touch me!
- Dominic!</line>

<line>Dominic! Listen to me.</line>

<line>Dominic!</line>

<line>Dominic, put the g*n down.
- Don't nobody touch me!</line>

<line>Listen to me.</line>

<line>Dominic, listen to me.</line>

<line>It's gonna be okay,</line>

<line>I promise you.</line>

<line>I promise you, Dominic.</line>

<line>It's going to be okay.</line>

<line>Put the g*n down.
- Listen, I wrote it.</line>

<line>The plan, I wrote it!</line>

<line>But I didn't send it.</line>

<line>Put the g*n down.</line>

<line>Dominic!</line>

<line>I didn't send it.</line>

<line>No, Dominic!</line>

<line>No!</line>

<line>I talked to the hospital.
It's looking bad.</line>

<line>But they can't say for sure right now.</line>

<line>If Dominic didn't send the plan...</line>

<line>then who did?</line>

<line>It's over, Lil.</line>

<line>Let's go home.</line>

<line>I've been looking for you all day.</line>

<line>Everywhere I'm looking for you.</line>

<line>God, Elisa.</line>

<line>I'm sorry.</line>

<line>You okay?</line>

<line>Hey. Talk to me.</line>

<line>They came back, Scotty.</line>

<line>The giants.</line>

<line>I know what you're thinking,</line>

<line>I know you think that
I didn't take my meds, but I did.</line>

<line>And they still came back.</line>

<line>Well, we'll get stronger meds.</line>

<line>We'll talk to the doctor to see whatever
to save. / That's what we did last time.</line>

<line>It's what we do all the time,
and it doesn't get better.</line>

<line>Maybe it just doesn't.</line>

<line>I'm gonna go stay at my sister's for a while.</line>

<line>That's what you want to do, do it.
- I don't know what else to do.</line>

<line>Do you?</line>

<line>Shirts two, skins zero.</line>

<line>There ain't no skins.</line>

<line>You know? You see that?
I mean, just... just look!</line>

<line>I meant before, when we were kids.</line>

<line>Let's go, Elisa. / Skins make
a comeback in the last inning.</line>

<line>Do you remember?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Triple play.
Scored by Scotty valens.</line>

<line>I don't remember.</line>

<line>I do.</line>

<line>That was a long time ago.
- Not so long ago, Scotty.</line>

<line>Not so long ago.</line>

<line>Dominic's in the ICU.</line>

<line>No word yet.</line>

<line>Last thing he said before
he shot himself was...</line>

<line>he didn't send the plan.</line>

<line>Then who did?</line>

<line>Was there someone else in
on this besides the three of you?</line>

<line>No, just us.</line>

<line>But someone else knew.</line>

<line>We lost it that night.</line>

<line>The plan?</line>

<line>It was in Dominic's pocket.</line>

<line>He stuck everything in his pockets.
- Dumbass.</line>

<line>And then it was gone after... the pool.</line>

<line>It was gone.</line>

<line>Where'd it go?</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>The plan! It was here.
- You put in your pocket?</line>

<line>You dumbass! / Shh!</line>

<line>Okay, it's okay.</line>

<line>Listen up, here's what we do.</line>

<line>Never tell.</line>

<line>No matter what happens.</line>

<line>If we're ever caught,
each man takes the fall.</line>

<line>By himself.</line>

<line>Alone.</line>

<line>Like a soldier.</line>

<line>Never tell.
- Never tell.</line>

<line>Never tell.</line>

<line>He went back to the pool that night.</line>

<line>Dominic, to look for it.
- Did he find it?</line>

<line>We never talked about it.</line>

<line>Like it never happened.</line>

<line>And after a while,
it felt like it never did.</line>

<line>He should have this, not me.</line>

<line>For what he did, what they all did.</line>

<line>Took more guts than I ever had.</line>

"<line>From the child comes forth the soldier."</line>

<line>That's what Nash always said.</line>

<line>After.</line>

<line>You were a lifer at the academy.</line>

<line>In Nash's swim class, long ago.</line>

<line>Not so long ago.</line>

<line>You were the duty sergeant that night.</line>

<line>You found Nash's body.</line>

<line>And the plan. / The world had to
know what he did to them.</line>

<line>To me.
- That's why you sent it in.</line>

<line>But why now, Creighton?</line>

<line>The last class of Nash's victims.
The last to bear witness.</line>

<line>Nash's secret would go away with them.</line>

<line>You couldn't let that happen.
- I didn't let that happen.</line>

<line>No, you didn't.</line>

<line>Why are you here?</line>

<line>You let these boys go, I'll tell you.</line>

<line>Depends on what you have to tell me.</line>

<line>I watch boys.</line>

<line>Just like Nash did,
I watch boys,</line>

<line>and I know that I'm becoming him.</line>

<line>Please put me away.</line>

<line>Stop me.
Let them have their lives.</line>

<line>Let them become men.</line>

<line>Just let them go.
- How can I?</line>

<line>They k*lled a man.
- No, they didn't.</line>

<line>Somebody's coming!</line>

<line>Creighton!</line>
