<line>You're gonna sleep
with mama tonight, okay?</line>

<line>Mama?</line>

<line>Uh-huh?</line>

<line>It's dark.</line>

<line>Shh.</line>

<line>It's gonna be okay.</line>

<line>Know why?</line>

'<line>Cause Mama says so?</line>

<line>Yeah, 'cause mama says so.</line>

<line>Mama?</line>

<line>Uh-huh?</line>

<line>He's not coming back, right?</line>

<line>No, he's not.</line>

<line>Now go to sleep.</line>

<line>Mama?</line>

<line>What, Toya?</line>

<line>You don't gotta cry no more.</line>

<line>Kid dies on impact.</line>

<line>Mother survives only to
lapse into a coma</line>

<line>a few hours after the attack.</line>

<line>Going on two years.</line>

<line>Two years in a coma?</line>

<line>Just saw your boy Kite
at the courthouse.</line>

<line>ADA Kite?</line>

<line>Mm-hmm.</line>

<line>That was Billy Markins' job, right?</line>

<line>Yeah, years on,
then hummer comes in.</line>

<line>Never got the doer.</line>

<line>Dead kid and her mom
thrown out a window.</line>

<line>How old's the job?</line>

?

<line>He asked about you.</line>

<line>Kite.</line>

<line>Yo, pass the ketchup?</line>

<line>Remember that picture Markins
had on his wall?</line>

<line>Yeah. Mom and a kid making a snowman.</line>

<line>That's the job?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Only case he left open when he retired.</line>

<line>What? So the assigned worked it good,
but got nada for his efforts?</line>

<line>His only witness was in a coma.</line>

<line>Mm.</line>

<line>What did he ask? Kite.</line>

<line>Where you were.</line>

<line>You getting a social life
going or something.</line>

<line>No way.</line>

<line>Good.</line>

<line>This Miles case has new direction.</line>

<line>Yeah?</line>

<line>Why're we interested now?</line>

<line>Because the mom just woke up.</line>

<line>How long has she been awake?</line>

<line>hours.</line>

<line>She talking?</line>

<line>She has lucid but minimal
verbal function.</line>

<line>She hasn't spoken of the incident</line>

<line>with her daughter yet.</line>

<line>Some people here to
see you, Miss Miles.</line>

<line>Hi, Rosie.</line>

<line>I'm Detective Rush.</line>

<line>Detective Valens.</line>

<line>How you doing?</line>

<line>Rosie, we're here to talk
to you about what happened.</line>

<line>To you and Toya.</line>

<line>Your little girl?</line>

<line>Toya...</line>

<line>Toya?</line>

<line>Is that what you're saying?</line>

<line>Butterflies.</line>

<line>Toya and... and butterflies...</line>

<line>They hurt...</line>

<line>They hurt... they hurt, Mama.</line>

<line>Bruises on her...</line>

<line>Toya had butterfly wings and bruises?</line>

<line>On her arms.</line>

<line>And... he bruised her up.</line>

<line>Who did?</line>

<line>The man.</line>

<line>What man, Rosie?</line>

<line>The one in...</line>

<line>one in the bedroom.</line>

<line>He would put bruises on her...</line>

<line>when she wouldn't smile at him.</line>

<line>Did you know him before that night?</line>

<line>What night?</line>

<line>The night Toya...</line>

<line>The night of the accident, Rosie.</line>

<line>What accident?</line>

<line>Doesn't she know?</line>

<line>I... I'm not sure.</line>

<line>Know what?</line>

<line>What am I supposed to know?</line>

<line>So, bruises and butterflies?</line>

<line>That's all Rosie remembers right now.</line>

<line>Long-term memory's intact,</line>

<line>but whatever went on that night...</line>

<line>Gone.</line>

<line>She didn't even know Toya was dead.</line>

<line>Gone forever?</line>

<line>Yeah. If she gets it back,
it'll come piecemeal.</line>

<line>Doctor says this type of
amnesia's emotional,</line>

<line>not physical, so she should remember...</line>

<line>The question is : Does she want to?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Rosie said the man in the bedroom</line>

<line>bruised up Toya when
she wouldn't smile.</line>

<line>Implying they knew him.</line>

<line>Yeah, but the assigned</line>

<line>thought the doer was a stranger.</line>

<line>You trade thoughts with Markins yet?</line>

<line>Caught up with him between
tee times in Myrtle Beach.</line>

<line>His theory was burglary gone bad.</line>

<line>The doer's on crack,
PCP breaks into the apartment,</line>

<line>not expecting Rosie to wake up.</line>

<line>She does, he panics,
and kills them both.</line>

<line>call came in at : p.m.,</line>

<line>few minutes after Rosie
and Toya hit the ground.</line>

<line>Voice was a black
male, never I.D.'d.</line>

<line>Plus Rosie's landlady</line>

<line>reported a black male
running from the scene.</line>

<line>Black man hauling a*s</line>

<line>through lily-white Port Richmond?</line>

<line>Stands out like Vera in a bikini.</line>

<line>Well, theory's decent.</line>

<line>Forced entry, struggle
in the bedroom, missing VCR.</line>

<line>I don't know</line>

<line>what the butterflies mean.</line>

<line>And I don't see any bruises on Toya.</line>

<line>Find the man in the bedroom,</line>

<line>I bet you'll get some answers.</line>

<line>Case number .</line>

<line>I was Rosie Miles'
court ordered supervisor</line>

<line>for, uh... for ten months.</line>

<line>Court ordered, Mr. Freely?</line>

<line>Yeah, Rosie got a DUI three years ago.</line>

<line>Judge didn't take the kid away,</line>

<line>but he assigned me
to be her caseworker.</line>

<line>Rosie have a drinking problem?</line>

<line>Pregnant at , dad's MIA
before her baby's born.</line>

<line>She realizes all she's got
to look forward to in life</line>

<line>is Pampers and stretch marks,</line>

<line>she finds God at the
bottom of a forty.</line>

<line>She ever hit Toya?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Ever notice any bruises?</line>

<line>Never. No, the court would have
taken her away if she did.</line>

<line>That's what I was there for.</line>

<line>You were at Rosie's apartment
the day of the m*rder, right?</line>

<line>Yeah, we call them
unannounced home visits.</line>

<line>Rosie's snoring,  TV's blasting,</line>

<line>kid's eating Ho Hos
for breakfast, the usual.</line>

<line>But you said in your report</line>

<line>that everything was satisfactory.</line>

<line>According to department
guidelines, it was.</line>

<line>Did she have a boyfriend
might've hurt Toya?</line>

<line>I don't think Rosie
liked men all that much.</line>

<line>Is that a fact?</line>

<line>I don't mean gay, just, uh...</line>

<line>Most of these girls...</line>

will give it up for a
<line>Big Mac and supersize fries.</line>

<line>But Rosie...</line>

<line>it was like she just
shut that door forever.</line>

<line>Toya loved to draw.</line>

<line>I never had the heart
to throw them away.</line>

<line>You saw Toya and her mother
the day of the m*rder.</line>

<line>At a school play?</line>

<line>Yes. We do that play every year</line>

"<line>The Flight of the
Monarch Butterflies."</line>

<line>The play was about butterflies?</line>

<line>It was. Yes.</line>

<line>Can you tell us what
you remember from that day?</line>

<line>Toya remembered all her lines.</line>

<line>She was the only one.</line>

<line>♪ Little monarch butterfly ♪</line>

<line>♪ Spread your wings and flutter high ♪</line>

<line>♪ Touch the sun and kiss the sky ♪</line>

<line>♪ Fly away, my butterfly ♪</line>

<line>♪ Little monarch butterfly ♪</line>

<line>♪ Spread your wings and flutter high ♪</line>

<line>Why was Rosie crying?</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>Did you ever see any marks
on Toya's arms, Mrs. Jablonski?</line>

<line>Bruises?</line>

<line>Signs of abuse?</line>

<line>No. We're trained to
look for those things.</line>

<line>That's not something</line>

<line>you forget, Detective.</line>

<line>Two years is a long time to remember.</line>

<line>Toya always came to school with a lunch.</line>

<line>Clean clothes.</line>

<line>She was a happy child.</line>

<line>Loved.</line>

<line>That's not something</line>

<line>you forget either...
not around here.</line>

<line>So this is the bedroom</line>

<line>where the m*rder took place?</line>

<line>Yup. No renter since Rosie.</line>

<line>Except my brother.</line>

<line>Comes from Poland, stays here.</line>

<line>God. Shut up, damn dogs. Be quiet!</line>

<line>Hate those dogs.</line>

<line>That wasn't in the crime scene photos.</line>

<line>Maybe a cable line.</line>

<line>Too big.</line>

<line>And too high up.</line>

<line>What happened to the bookshelf
that was against this wall, Tammy?</line>

<line>Oh. My place.</line>

<line>Oh, yeah?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>I keep it for Rosie. So what?</line>

<line>Ever see any bruises on Toya?</line>

<line>Bruises? No, no, no.</line>

<line>Rosie never touch that girl.</line>

<line>Never. Never. Uh-uh.</line>

<line>Maybe one of her boyfriends did.</line>

<line>Says here you saw someone</line>

<line>running from the building that night.</line>

<line>Yeah. Black.</line>

<line>He run and run and run.</line>

<line>Maybe he was her boyfriend.</line>

<line>Right. When pigs fly.</line>

<line>Rosie got a problem with black man?</line>

<line>No, I got a problem.</line>

<line>My building, my rules.</line>

<line>Okay?</line>

<line>Men at Rosie's that night? Yes.</line>

<line>Black in my building? No.</line>

<line>Men at Rosie's? What night?</line>

<line>The night Toya falls.</line>

<line>I hear men voices.</line>

<line>The night she died?</line>

<line>Yeah. In and out, climb up,
down the stairs.</line>

<line>You didn't mention that two years ago.</line>

<line>I see black run.</line>

<line>I told about black.</line>

<line>Black did it.</line>

<line>You see men come up in
this place a lot, Tammy?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>But one bedroom apartment... come on.</line>

<line>Toya sleeps on the couch, I think.</line>

<line>Wait. Rosie made her kid</line>

<line>sleep in the living room?</line>

<line>So Rosie keep the bedroom
for herself for reason, no?</line>

<line>But I don't make judgement.</line>

<line>Like you are.</line>

<line>Like now.</line>

<line>We got a uniform
posted at the hospital?</line>

<line>Yeah. No visitors for Rosie yet.</line>

<line>No family?</line>

<line>Mm-mm. Parents are dead.</line>

<line>This job ain't coming in, boss.</line>

<line>We got nothing.</line>

<line>We got a witness.</line>

<line>Whose hard drive's been erased.</line>

"<line>Bruises and butterflies",</line>

<line>that's her big contribution.</line>

<line>It's more than Markins had.</line>

<line>How do we know we can trust it?</line>

<line>The bruises didn't pan out.</line>

<line>Well, the butterflies meant something.</line>

<line>Keep looking at the bruises.</line>

<line>CSU figured out the hole in the wall.</line>

<line>Rosie's living room.</line>

<line>The missing VCR went on top of the  TV.</line>

<line>Okay, living room again.</line>

<line>Missing VCR cables must
have run through this hole</line>

<line>leaving these tiny black streaks.</line>

<line>CSU says it's the same rubber
used in VCR cables.</line>

<line>So the cable from the VCR</line>

<line>in the living room connected to what?</line>

<line>Something in the bedroom.</line>

<line>I don't see anything
it could have been connected to.</line>

<line>Maybe because it was hidden.</line>

<line>What do you connect
a VCR to if not a TV?</line>

<line>A video camera.</line>

<line>Why did Rosie have a video
camera in her bedroom?</line>

<line>Was she making porn?</line>

<line>Blackmailing someone?</line>

<line>Doer's married, having a fling.</line>

<line>Rosie threatens to tell the wife.</line>

<line>Except Rosie's bank account
totaled a whopping</line>

$ . ... <line>that spell
extortion to you?</line>

<line>On public assistence,</line>

<line>you can't have more than
a few hundred bucks in the bank.</line>

<line>That makes saving easy.</line>

<line>Welcome to welfare.</line>

<line>If Rosie was squirreling away a stash,</line>

<line>she'd have to hide it real good.</line>

<line>Or lose the food stamps.</line>

<line>Check her belongings for video tapes.</line>

<line>You and Vera try pawnshops
in Port Richmond</line>

<line>for the camera and VCR.</line>

<line>If we find the tape,
maybe we find the doer.</line>

<line>Real nice of Tammy to let us in.</line>

<line>Hmm.</line>

<line>Real nice of her to keep
Rosie's furniture.</line>

<line>How come you don't like Rosie?</line>

<line>I like her fine.</line>

'<line>Cause she got a DUI?</line>

<line>With Toya in the car.</line>

<line>Well, she shaped up after that.</line>

<line>Paid the price.</line>

<line>Only one that paid was her kid, Scotty.</line>

<line>Yeah, well...</line>

<line>I think Rosie paid, too.</line>

<line>Look what I found.</line>

<line>Blank pages, all of them.</line>

<line>So?</line>

<line>Wonder why this page is missing?</line>

<line>As luck would have it,</line>

<line>we purchased this
model six months ago.</line>

<line>What's it do?</line>

<line>Clarifies residuum</line>

<line>otherwise imperceptible
to the naked eye.</line>

<line>Talk down to me.</line>

<line>It sees the imprint
from your missing page.</line>

<line>It's the high-tech version</line>

<line>of rubbing a pencil against a pad.</line>

<line>Like that, yeah.</line>

<line>Hope you got gloves.
It's freezing out there.</line>

<line>Hmm.</line>

<line>Any luck in the pawn shops?</line>

<line>Yeah, we tracked a VCR and camera,</line>

<line>same make and model as Rosie's.</line>

<line>Pete's pawnshop in Port Richmond.</line>

<line>Rosie's hood.</line>

<line>Guy dumped it almost a year
after the m*rder.</line>

<line>Heat was off by then.</line>

<line>Petey's got a slip for
a guy named Angel.</line>

<line>No last name.</line>

<line>Angel?</line>

<line>Eh, could be a dead end.</line>

<line>Or not.</line>

<line>Traced a missing page
from Rosie's address book.</line>

<line>Disconnected page number
for an Angel Rivera.</line>

<line>Janitor at Toya's school.</line>

<line>Angel Rivera?</line>

<line>Detectives Rush, Valens.</line>

<line>Homicide.</line>

<line>You know a Rosie Miles, Angel?</line>

<line>A who?</line>

<line>Wonder why she'd have
his pager number?</line>

<line>He not knowing her and all.</line>

<line>Maybe 'cause he's lying?</line>

<line>Yeah. Whatever.</line>

<line>So, who's Jasmine Cordoba?</line>

<line>What's she got to do with it?</line>

<line>That your girlfriend, Angel?</line>

<line>Hear she pays your rent,
utilities, your car.</line>

<line>You make your woman</line>

<line>pay the bills?</line>

<line>Must be packing some kind of punch</line>

<line>in those baggies, huh, Angel?</line>

<line>You wanna find out?</line>

<line>Make a move.</line>

'<line>Cept Jasmine ain't his girlfriend.</line>

<line>No?</line>

<line>Nah.</line>

<line>She's his mama.</line>

<line>Ooh...</line>

<line>She do your laundry, too?</line>

<line>Wash your diapers, papi?</line>

<line>Help you make number two on the potty?</line>

<line>I live with my ma; so what?</line>

<line>Your mother's here illegally.</line>

<line>We ain't gonna let Immigration know.</line>

<line>You help us out.</line>

<line>Me and Rosie, a few times.</line>

<line>It wasn't nothing.</line>

<line>She feel the same way?</line>

<line>She wanted this, wanted that.</line>

"<line>Keep an eye on my kid, Angel.</line>

<line>Make sure she don't fall off
the Jungle gym, Angel."</line>

<line>I was in it for the sumpin' sumpin',</line>

<line>not to be playin' papi.</line>

<line>You seeing Rosie</line>

<line>when her kid got k*lled?</line>

<line>Nah. Kicked her to the curb</line>

<line>way back when.</line>

<line>Hooked up with Gina.</line>

<line>Gave old white girl the boot.</line>

<line>Then what were you doing</line>

<line>in white girl's apartment that night?</line>

<line>We got your prints</line>

<line>on her video camera, Angel.</line>

<line>You know,</line>

<line>the one you pawned?</line>

<line>That day her kid was... whatever,</line>

<line>I see Rosie in the school.</line>

<line>At Toya's butterfly play?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Crying and acting stupid.</line>

<line>Rosie was making a phone call?</line>

<line>Yeah. Then she sees me, hangs up,</line>

<line>starts blubbering in my face
about butterflies</line>

<line>and some guy's gonna hurt her,</line>

<line>blase blah.</line>

<line>What guy?</line>

<line>I don't know; I told her to step off.</line>

<line>You know mean, not my problem.</line>

<line>Rosie freaks.</line>

<line>She starts shouting, screaming</line>

<line>how she's got some tape... us in bed.</line>

<line>If I don't help her, she's gonna</line>

<line>tell Gina, blase blah.</line>

<line>Pissed you off, huh?</line>

<line>Hell, ye.</line>

<line>So, you went over there that night</line>

<line>and taught her a lesson, right?</line>

<line>Hell, yeah.</line>

<line>Mommy!</line>

<line>Angel. Jesus.</line>

<line>Get out of here!</line>

<line>What are you doing?</line>

<line>Mommy.</line>

<line>You're scaring Toya.</line>

<line>Angel, got out of here!</line>

<line>Mommy!</line>

<line>Are you gonna tape me, b*tch.</line>

<line>Don't you hurt my mama!</line>

<line>I'm gonna call the cops, Angel.</line>

<line>No, no, not that tape.</line>

<line>Not that.</line>

<line>Don't do that.</line>

<line>Mommy.</line>

<line>Not that.</line>

<line>And then I left.</line>

<line>Truth is, I didn't care
enough to k*ll them.</line>

<line>Cared enough to hit her.</line>

<line>I didn't hit her; I pushed her.</line>

<line>Out the window?</line>

<line>I didn't do nothing!</line>

<line>I got the tape to prove it.</line>

<line>What tape?</line>

<line>Tape from that night</line>

<line>I ain't on it.</line>

<line>So, that's proof I ain't do nothing.</line>

<line>Nothing but pawn</line>

<line>her VCR and camera a year later.</line>

<line>Where's this tape you got, Angel?</line>

<line>This was recorded in
your apartment, Rosie.</line>

<line>It's a security camera.</line>

<line>Who's that man?</line>

<line>That's what we were
hoping you'd tell us.</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>You remember this camera, Rosie?</line>

<line>You had it in your bedroom.</line>

<line>I did?</line>

<line>You remember someone named Angel?</line>

<line>You told him someone
was out to hurt you.</line>

<line>You asked Angel for help that day.</line>

<line>If I don't remember who he is,</line>

<line>how am I gonna remember
what I said to him?</line>

<line>We're trying to help, Rosie.</line>

<line>What for?</line>

<line>So you can get your memory back.</line>

<line>Like I said... what for?</line>

<line>Let's go.</line>

<line>It's not mine.</line>

<line>It's hers.</line>

<line>It's Toya's.</line>

<line>What's Toya's?</line>

<line>The bedroom.</line>

<line>It's Toya's bedroom.</line>

<line>I remember that now.</line>

<line>Why does Rosie put</line>

<line>a security camera in
her daughter's bedroom?</line>

<line>Worried something's
happening to Toya there.</line>

<line>Nothing the autopsy report</line>

<line>says any about sexual abuse.</line>

<line>Well, maybe it was just starting.</line>

<line>And that's why the camera.</line>

<line>Rosie knew what he was doing.</line>

<line>She was trying to stop him.</line>

<line>And maybe he's trying to stop her</line>

<line>from ratting him out.</line>

<line>Ten G's buys a lot of
"don't ask, don't tell."</line>

<line>I found the bank account</line>

<line>under Rosie's social security number</line>

<line>and her name.</line>

<line>The assigned missed that?</line>

<line>Didn't exist till three days ago.</line>

<line>When Rosie woke up.</line>

<line>Who set up the account?</line>

<line>McLean Wykowski.</line>

<line>Foreman, Mills Lightman Construction.</line>

<line>No record.</line>

<line>What's his connection to Rosie?</line>

<line>Wife's maiden name... Miles.</line>

<line>Lorraine Miles.</line>

<line>He's Rosie's dad.</line>

<line>So, Rosie tells you</line>

<line>her folks died, and you
don't check that out?</line>

<line>With the number of cases I got,
it comes down to triage.</line>

<line>You keep a roof over their heads,</line>

<line>you keep the food stamps coming in.</line>

<line>So, where do we look</line>

<line>for suspected physical,
sexual abuse, huh?</line>

<line>Hospital admissions,</line>

<line>uh, foster care reports.</line>

<line>All miscellaneous stuff
we didn't get to.</line>

<line>This cabinet, Mr. Freely?</line>

<line>All of this.</line>

<line>There are only so
many hours in the day.</line>

<line>And so many kids.</line>

<line>How do we find Toya in all of this?</line>

"<line>M" for Miles.</line>

<line>Familiar territory?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>You knew that food stamp
drill pretty good.</line>

<line>Case number .</line>

<line>Ellen Rush, two dependents.</line>

<line>Valens.</line>

<line>Uh, McLean? You bringing him in?</line>

<line>Good.</line>

<line>Jeffries and Vera just picked up
Rosie's dad at the shipyard.</line>

<line>What do you got?</line>

"<line>M" for Miles.</line>

<line>That's why Rosie saw the bruises.</line>

<line>That picture don't look like Toya.</line>

<line>It's not.</line>

<line>It's Rosie.</line>

<line>When was the last time</line>

<line>you saw your daughter, McLean?</line>

<line>Five,</line>

<line>six years. Lost track.</line>

<line>And you never visited Rosie</line>

<line>all the time she was in the hospital?</line>

<line>Then why'd you set up
an account for her...</line>

<line>you not givin' a crap and all?</line>

<line>I'm her pops. I wanted to help her.</line>

<line>Or shut her up.</line>

<line>You know how Toya died?</line>

<line>Backbone busted to bits.</line>

<line>Skull, too.</line>

<line>Oh, no open casket for her.</line>

<line>Violent guy who'd do
something like that, huh?</line>

<line>I wouldn't know.</line>

<line>Hit me.</line>

<line>Show me what you did to Rosie
when she was little girl.</line>

<line>Come on. You like hittin' girls.</line>

<line>Hit me.</line>

<line>Gonorrhea when she was eight.</line>

<line>Again when she was ten.</line>

<line>You did a lot more than
just hit Rosie, didn't you?</line>

<line>Rosie made a call
at the school that day.</line>



<line>We traced it to the shipyard, to you.</line>

<line>What'd she call you about?</line>

<line>Talkin' crazy, like she was drunk.</line>

<line>Goin' on about butterflies.</line>

<line>And that someone was
gonna hurt Toya, right?</line>

<line>So you went there that night.</line>

<line>No, I-I went home.</line>

<line>Tell them</line>

<line>you went home, after Rosie called,</line>

<line>begging for help.</line>

<line>I did.</line>

<line>Don't look at me.</line>

<line>Look at them.</line>

<line>You tell Toya.</line>

<line>Tell Rosie.</line>

<line>You tell them, not me.</line>

<line>I-I-I sat outside
her place in the dark...</line>

<line>and I-I-I didn't go there</line>

<line>'cause I thought she was in trouble.</line>

<line>Then why'd you go?</line>

<line>To tell her I was sorry...</line>

<line>for when she was little...</line>

<line>for what I done.</line>

<line>I sat outside her place,</line>

<line>but I couldn't go in.</line>

<line>So you saw some pizza delivery guy</line>

<line>go up to Rosie's place.</line>

<line>What'd this guy look like?</line>

<line>Young guy.</line>

<line>Black guy.</line>

<line>Did a black man come
over that night, Rosie,</line>

<line>maybe... delivering a pizza?</line>

<line>Maybe you were seeing him?</line>

<line>How about this, uh,</line>

<line>ponytail guy?</line>

<line>You starting to recognize him?</line>

<line>Maybe you met him at a bar...</line>

<line>a club?</line>

<line>That wasn't me.</line>

<line>What you're saying...</line>

<line>that wasn't how it was.</line>

<line>Then tell us, Rosie,</line>

<line>how it was.</line>

<line>Uh, Toya...</line>

<line>loved her... her...</line>

<line>butterfly wind chimes.</line>

<line>I put'em up in a window... for her.</line>

<line>Then he'd come</line>

<line>at night...</line>

<line>late at night.</line>

<line>Who would?</line>

<line>The man who gave Toya the wind chimes.</line>

<line>They ain't optimistic
'bout getting prints</line>

<line>off of them chimes.</line>

<line>I know.</line>

<line>Well, maybe we get lucky.</line>

<line>If not... well, we'll
get something else tomorrow.</line>

<line>Yeah, well, maybe Rosie's
better off not knowing.</line>

<line>Not knowing what?</line>

<line>How she was with Toya,</line>

<line>how they lived.</line>

<line>They were doing okay.</line>

<line>What, on welfare, with a DUI?</line>

<line>People make mistakes.</line>

<line>They clean up.</line>

<line>Your mom ever forget to feed you...</line>

'<line>cause she was too drunk... or tired...</line>

<line>or out looking for a man?</line>

<line>Nah.</line>

<line>Toya's a dime a dozen.</line>

<line>Unwanted kid.</line>

<line>Mom runs out of food
stamps, makes an excuse</line>

<line>why there's no dinner tonight...</line>

<line>or, uh, no breakfast, either,</line>

<line>so thank God for the free corn flakes</line>

<line>at school, if you get there early,</line>

<line>and maybe some kid'll give you
scraps out of his lunch box</line>

<line>later on.</line>

<line>So your mom was going
through bad times.</line>

<line>Scotty...</line>

<line>there was never a good time.</line>

<line>Oh, you're telling me not once
did you have fun with your mom?</line>

<line>I mean, not once did you feel...</line>

<line>some kind of love?</line>

<line>Maybe tomorrow we bring
Rosie home, huh?</line>

<line>If you can't do this...</line>

<line>No, I-I want to.</line>

<line>Mama?</line>

<line>Mama...</line>

<line>She was drawing.</line>

<line>She was... hiding and drawing...</line>

<line>Why was she hiding?</line>

<line>Because he's coming...</line>

<line>from there...</line>

<line>Rosie.</line>

<line>He was standing there.</line>

<line>It's just Scotty.</line>

<line>He's not gonna hurt you, okay?</line>

<line>He's not gonna hurt you.</line>

<line>Lil.</line>

<line>Look at this.</line>

<line>Kind of a ponytail guy.</line>

"<line>Frely".</line>

<line>Freely.</line>

<line>Mr. Freely.</line>

<line>The social worker.</line>

<line>Cut your hair.</line>

<line>Big improvement.</line>

<line>Wanna see the rest?</line>

<line>I do. Play it.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>There's nothing on the tape.</line>

<line>Rosie tried that bluff on you.</line>

<line>Didn't work, though, did it?</line>

<line>I don't know, what you're, uh...</line>

'<line>Cause you hadn't done anything to Toya...</line>

<line>not yet.</line>

<line>You were circling, though.</line>

<line>Moven' in.</line>

<line>And Rosie knew it...</line>

'<line>cause she was real familiar</line>

<line>with the danger signs.</line>

<line>Rosie's, uh...</line>

<line>damaged goods,</line>

<line>if you haven't noticed that already.</line>

<line>You know what bugs me?</line>

<line>This camera's been in
her place for weeks,</line>

<line>but she picks this day
to go to people for help.</line>

<line>Why?</line>

<line>What happened on this day
that was so different?</line>

<line>She caught you.</line>

<line>That morning,</line>

<line>starting your act with Toya.</line>

<line>That's crap.</line>

<line>And she threatened you.</line>

"<line>I have a tape, Freely,
back the hell off."</line>

<line>Oh, and that pissed you off.</line>

<line>Who was she, talking to you like that?</line>

<line>So that night, you went back...</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>You used your position</line>

<line>to get in her home and
check out her little girl.</line>

<line>Knowing</line>

<line>the power you had...</line>

<line>and Rosie wasn't the only one.</line>

<line>You were like God to these women.</line>

<line>You had the power to give, to take...</line>

<line>and you did.</line>

<line>Like anyone gives a damn.</line>

<line>Trailer park trash.</line>

<line>Welfare queens.</line>

<line>Like you care what happens to them.</line>

<line>They care.</line>

<line>Anita Jones,</line>

<line>Carmen Torres,</line>

<line>Dana Matthews,</line>

<line>Leena Young,</line>

<line>all their pretty little girls.</line>

<line>They're here.</line>

<line>They've come here to tell us all about...</line>

<line>Mr. Freely.</line>

<line>You wanna talk before they do?</line>

<line>Rosie, uh...</line>

<line>threatened me that morning...</line>

<line>but not with any tape.</line>

<line>Hello, little girl.</line>

<line>Where's your mommy?</line>

<line>Shower.</line>

<line>Mommy.</line>

<line>That's, uh...</line>

<line>Good little girls don't yell, do they?</line>

<line>Mommy says nobody can come in here.</line>

<line>Mr. Freely can.</line>

<line>You look pretty, Toya.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>Say,</line>

"<line>Thank you, Mr. Freely."</line>

<line>Thank you, Mr. Freely.</line>

<line>You're a good, good girl.</line>

<line>Don't ya touch her!</line>

<line>I know what you're doing.</line>

<line>I know what you are!</line>

<line>Have you been drinking?</line>

<line>I can smell it on your breath, Rosie.</line>

<line>Get out. Get out of my house.</line>

<line>Judge isn't gonna look too
kindly on that, you know.</line>

<line>Not with a DUI and all.</line>

<line>You know I stopped. I told you...</line>

<line>I tell you!</line>

<line>You don't tell me!</line>

<line>You drunk, dumb b*tch!</line>

<line>Oh, it's some answer,
it's a... good thing I'm came here.</line>

<line>Oh, this place's all wreck.</line>

<line>How do you raise a
child in this field?</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>I was wrong, Mr. Freely.</line>

<line>I was wrong.</line>

<line>I've made my decision.</line>

<line>It's time to find a new home for Toya.</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>I'm gonna have to take care</line>

<line>of that pretty little
girl all by myself.</line>

<line>You just wait for the
knock on the door, Rosie...</line>

<line>when you least expect it.</line>

<line>That's all I did.</line>

<line>And then I left.</line>

<line>Talk about that night, Freely.</line>

<line>When you went back.</line>

<line>I-I wasn't there...</line>

<line>I hate a liar, man.</line>

<line>Something you wanna see.</line>

<line>No prints on the chimes,
but look at this.</line>

<line>P. Williams?</line>

<line>Who's that?</line>

<line>Philip Williams.</line>

<line>at the time of the m*rder.</line>

<line>He worked at Toya's school.</line>

<line>Doing arts and crafts
with the first graders.</line>

<line>Making wind chimes.</line>

<line>Doesn't mean we got the wrong guy.</line>

<line>He worked as a Pizza delivery boy.</line>

<line>The guy the father was
that night, dialing ...</line>

<line>running from the scene.</line>

<line>Philip Williams?</line>

<line>Detectives Rush, Valens.</line>

<line>Homicide.</line>

<line>I was wondering when you'd come.</line>

<line>You gonna arrest me this very minute,</line>

<line>or can I finish this play?</line>

<line>Why do you think we're
here to arrest you?</line>

<line>m*rder one, second degree m*rder,</line>

<line>attempted m*rder, you pick.</line>

<line>Ends up in the same place.</line>

<line>Did you k*ll Toya, Philip?</line>

<line>Looks like it, doesn't it?</line>

<line>Then why call ?</line>

<line>If you didn't do it,
why not come forward?</line>

<line>A black man running from the bodies</line>

<line>of a white woman and white child.</line>

<line>Would you?</line>

<line>What happend to you, Philip?</line>

"<line>A" student, honors society,
budding artist.</line>

<line>Then Toya Miles died</line>

<line>and you end up here.</line>

<line>At the bottom of the world.</line>

<line>What happened that night</line>

<line>brought you to a place
you don't belong?</line>

<line>Leftovers.</line>

<line>They'd throw them out
at the pizza place.</line>

<line>I'd bring them over to Toya,
from time to time.</line>

<line>That night, when I went over,</line>

<line>Rosie's apartment door was busted open.</line>

<line>What happened then?</line>

<line>I opened the bedroom door.</line>

<line>Who was in the bedroom?</line>

<line>Who was there, Philip?</line>

<line>No one.</line>

<line>No one.</line>

<line>Hospital says I'm okay to go home.</line>

<line>I know.</line>

<line>But where's home?</line>

<line>I know why you were crying
at the butterfly play.</line>

<line>Because you tried to stop Mr. Freely...</line>

<line>but you knew you couldn't...</line>

'<line>cause men like him never stop.</line>

<line>No, they don't.</line>

<line>No one was there for you.</line>

<line>Not your dad,</line>

<line>not Angel.</line>

<line>Just you.</line>

<line>So you did the only thing you could.</line>

<line>I did?</line>

<line>Is that why you can't remember?</line>

<line>The DA won't press charges,</line>

<line>not after what you've gone through.</line>

<line>What did I do?</line>

<line>There's a place for you to go,</line>

<line>to heal.</line>

<line>Just for a little while, Rosie...</line>

<line>because you didn't mean</line>

<line>what you did.</line>

<line>What did I do?</line>

<line>Mama?</line>

<line>You just wait...</line>

<line>for the knock at the door, Rosie...</line>

<line>when you least expect it.</line>
