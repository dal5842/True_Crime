<line>Oh, she was something else.</line>

<line>You best keep it down

<line>She gonna kick us all out.</line>

<line>Sadie, honey, miss Marion's

<line>when she done drunk a whole jug
of hooch herself.</line>

<line>You're damn right.</line>

<line>Don't you talk mean about my mama.</line>

<line>Who you think you sassing, girl?</line>

<line>Can I have a nip?</line>

<line>Your mama gonna have a fit
she catch you up.</line>

<line>I'll tuck you in a sec.</line>

<line>Hey, Sadie, you said you was
going to the juke joint.</line>

<line>Not tonight.</line>

<line>Well, honey, my candy man pay

<line>work tonight.</line>

<line>Candy man give you candy, miss Blanche?</line>

<line>You wanna call it that, honey.</line>

<line>Go on to bed.</line>

<line>Go on.</line>

<line>Arletta make you think on your
own little girl, huh, Sadie?</line>

<line>Where you say your girl stay at?</line>

<line>Virginia.
She with my cousin.</line>

<line>I bring her up when I get
the money saved.</line>

<line>Blanche?
Manross waiting!</line>

<line>Miss Blanche, miss Sadie.</line>

<line>Go, Manross, go!</line>

<line>Wait proper-like.</line>

<line>Candy man looking mighty fine.</line>

<line>I thought you said
you was working tonight.</line>

<line>I am, honey.</line>

<line>Whoo!</line>

<line>You a big ten years old today.</line>

<line>Happy birthday, baby girl.</line>

<line>When my mother passed away a few weeks ago,</line>

<line>I found this letter among
her belongings hidden away.</line>

<line>It's the last letter that my
grandmother ever wrote to her.</line>

<line>When was your grandmother m*rder*d?</line>

.

<line>Her name was Sadie douglas.</line>

<line>Came from Virginia.</line>

<line>Moved north to find work in the ' s.</line>

<line>I don't know much more than that.</line>

<line>Your mom didn't talk about her?</line>

<line>She was only ten years old
when Sadie was k*lled.</line>

<line>And she never really forgave
her for what she was.</line>

<line>Which was what?</line>

<line>The police called her a common
two-bit hooker.</line>

<line>My mother referred to her
as a white man's whore.</line>

<line>It was hard for her, knowing
that that's where she came from.</line>

<line>How about you?</line>

<line>Maybe it's affected me somewhat, too.</line>

<line>These letters you have are from ?</line>

<line>Sadie wrote one to her every week.</line>

<line>Look, I know I'm asking a lot,</line>

<line>but Sadie mentioned someone,</line>

<line>here.</line>

"<line>He best not hurt me.</line>

<line>That milkman
best not hurt your mama."</line>

<line>What milkman?
- I don't know.</line>

<line>She never referred to him
in her other letters.</line>

<line>Back then, the police said Sadie was</line>

a prost*tute k*lled randomly
<line>by a John, but...</line>

<line>I think my grandmother knew her k*ller.</line>

<line>Homicides,</line>

<line>assaults, r*pes...</line>

<line>basically every criminal record
before is filed here.</line>

<line>County even sticks us with
their medical charts, too.</line>

<line>We need homicides.</line>

<line>Right down there.</line>

<line>I thought you said they were filed.</line>

<line>They were, once.
I mean, what's the point?</line>

<line>Doers are probably dust in the wind.</line>

<line>Thanks.</line>

<line>Don't want to waste any more
of your precious time.</line>

<line>Or cut into your
web-surfing activities.</line>

.

<line>White woman stabbed.</line>

<line>Suspect, White male with...
get this,</line>

<line>slender build and black whiskers.</line>

...

...

...

<line>it's a m*rder ledger, Scotty.</line>

<line>Going all the way back to .</line>

<line>years of m*rder and mayhem.</line>

<line>All in a you-stash-it off the highway.</line>

<line>Yo.</line>

<line>I found Sadie.</line>

<line>I had to put them in plastic.
They were falling apart in our hands.</line>

<line>Sadie douglas.
Colored female.</line>

<line>Nativity, Virginia.
Occupation, prost*tute.</line>

<line>Resided at a boarding house
for colored women.</line>

<line>Proprietor was a miss Thea marion.</line>

<line>Women in the boarding
house were all hookers.</line>

<line>Sadie was r*ped and suffocated
at the hand of an unknown assailant.</line>

<line>Maybe our milkman.</line>

<line>A ticket for New York
dated the night of</line>

<line>the m*rder found
in the victim's belongings.</line>

<line>Sadie's daughter
was living in Virginia.</line>

<line>So why is she going to New York?</line>

<line>Last to see her was another tenant
at the boarding house,</line>

<line>colored female, .</line>

<line>Blanche D.</line>

<line>The rest of her name is missing.</line>

<line>You find Blanche,
maybe we find out
why Sadie was going to New York.</line>

<line>Like the geezer's gonna remember.</line>

<line>You and Mr. Sensitivity track
down the milk companies</line>

<line>that delivered to Sadie's
boarding house.</line>

<line>Rush and Valens'll be on geezer patrol.</line>

<line>Looks like she fought back.</line>

<line>Something under her nails?</line>

<line>Back then it didn't matter.</line>

<line>It does now.</line>

<line>So if the family gives the green light...</line>

<line>maybe we dig her up?</line>

<line>Yep. Go talk to her granddaughter.</line>

<line>An exhumation?</line>

<line>Is that really necessary?</line>

<line>She may have fought her k*ller, Sarah.</line>

<line>We might get something useful.</line>

<line>Match the DNA to the doer
or his descendants,</line>

<line>if either's in the system.</line>

<line>All right.</line>

<line>I'll sign whatever papers you need.</line>

<line>Last to see your grandmother alive
was a woman named Blanche.</line>

<line>You recall that name
in any of her letters?</line>

<line>Blanche...</line>

<line>Sadie wrote about a fair
she went to with a Blanche.</line>

<line>That's them.</line>

<line>I had my first cotton candy today.</line>

<line>Like eating sugar from a cloud...</line>

<line>First thing you come up,</line>

<line>I'm gonna get you your own
cotton candy, baby.</line>

<line>We'll be so happy together.</line>

<line>Your mama misses
you like dry land for rain.</line>

<line>Love, mama.</line>

<line>She sent that photo with this letter.</line>

<line>Could I take this and the letters?</line>

<line>Will you bring them back?</line>

<line>They're all I have left of her.</line>

<line>Thing's making me seasick.</line>

<line>At least I got my roll on.
You can't even do yours.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Stop.</line>

<line>Damn thing's gonna explode.</line>

<line>Good lord.</line>

<line>Looks like a Baylor's
milk company delivered</line>

<line>to north th street through the s.</line>

<line>Where Sadie's boarding house was.</line>

<line>Board of revenue's got Baylor's
employee records to .</line>

<line>But nothing for .</line>

<line>So why is that year missing?</line>

<line>Fire.
January .</line>

<line>Company stopped keeping
records after that.</line>

<line>Fire must've really wiped them out.
They went out of business a year later.</line>

<line>If this fire cost lives, newspapers
would have carried accounts, right?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>So maybe our milkman's in one
of those newspapers?</line>

<line>We sure this place got prostitution
arrests before ?</line>

<line>Hookers, homicides,</line>

<line>the works.</line>

<line>If Blanche got picked up,</line>

<line>we'll find her here.</line>

<line>Wonder where she is now.</line>

<line>Wherever hookers who make
it to end up.</line>

<line>Let's hope it ain't hooker heaven.</line>

<line>Debbins, blanche.</line>

<line>This our girl?</line>

<line>She's a dead-ringer for this Blanche.</line>

<line>Arrested for prostitution in .</line>

<line>Delaney manross paid for her bail.</line>

<line>Manross delaney?
The candy man?</line>

<line>Delaney's delights?</line>

<line>You never had a Delaney delight?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Guy's got a candy franchise.
Been raking it in forever.</line>

<line>Maybe our h**ker's moved up
in the world, hmm?</line>

<line>Blanche debbins?</line>

<line>I ain't used that name in decades.</line>

<line>Whaddya you want, honey?</line>

<line>Philadelphia homicide,
miss Blanche.</line>

<line>And the police, too.</line>

<line>Make me feel young again.</line>

<line>Honey! Manross!</line>

<line>I'm watching my talk show, honey!
- Well turn it off, honey!</line>

<line>We got guests.</line>

<line>That was the depression, honey.</line>

<line>Times were hard all over,</line>

<line>especially for colored women
coming up alone from the south.</line>

<line>You did what you could
to make ends meet.</line>

<line>Today's young people
don't understand.</line>

<line>You all help yourself.</line>

<line>Try my number nine.</line>

<line>He gets on his high horse sometimes.</line>

<line>Don't mind him.
That's what I do.</line>

<line>Isn't that right, candy man?</line>

<line>Day she called me candy man,</line>

<line>I fell head over heels.</line>

<line>Been falling for her ever since.</line>

<line>Do you know anything about a trip</line>

<line>Sadie was taking to New York,
miss Blanche, night she was k*lled?</line>

<line>She told us she was going to bed.</line>

<line>Not to New York.</line>

<line>Well, did Sadie ever mention anyone,</line>

<line>maybe a milkman she was afraid of?</line>

<line>That rebby boy, what's his name?</line>

<line>Southern rebel wannabe.</line>

<line>Wasn't more than northern White Tr*sh.</line>

<line>what was his name?</line>

<line>I don't recall, honey.</line>

<line>Pierce. That was his name.</line>

<line>Had burns all over his face.</line>

<line>I'm telling the story, honey.</line>

<line>He had burns all over his face.</line>

<line>Had it out for Sadie, too.</line>

<line>All because of that damn milk.</line>

<line>I ain't getting out.</line>

<line>Not for no colored whorehouse.</line>

<line>Let them get their own damn milk.</line>

<line>Oh, here comes another one.</line>

<line>She looks almost white, don't she?</line>

<line>Come and get it!</line>

<line>Who that cooze think she is, huh?</line>

<line>Hey, dump it! / Huh?</line>

<line>I said dump it, Jonesy!</line>

<line>Let her clean it up.</line>

<line>Don't.</line>

<line>Sadie turned and walked
right back into the house</line>

<line>and left that milk out in the street.</line>

<line>That other milkman wasn't no better.</line>

<line>Didn't I say I'm telling the story?</line>

<line>This, uh, Pierce
cause any other trouble?</line>

<line>Not that Sadie mentioned.</line>

<line>I avoided him and his milk truck after that.</line>

<line>But Sadie was afraid he might hurt her.</line>

<line>Wrote about him
in a letter to her daughter.</line>

<line>Honey, Sadie couldn't read or write.</line>

<line>None of us could back then.</line>

<line>But she sent letters to her daughter.</line>

<line>Lots of them.</line>

<line>Well, she might have sent them,</line>

<line>but she sure didn't write them.</line>

<line>So who wrote Sadie's letters?</line>

<line>No one in the house could read or write.</line>

<line>A John, maybe?</line>

<line>Whoever it was might've
known more about the milkman.</line>

<line>Well, if the milkman was this guy Pierce,</line>

<line>then we might have the answer.</line>

<line>Newspaper from .</line>

<line>Pierce mcclintock listed as a burn victim
in the Baylor's milk company fire.</line>

<line>The same company delivered milk
to Sadie's boarding house.</line>

<line>Yep. Fire was set by pissed off
white workers</line>

<line>when the company hired blacks.</line>

k*lled ten, injured five more,
<line>including Pierce.</line>

<line>But lucky for us,</line>

<line>newspapers back then printed
the victims' addresses.</line>

<line>north th street.</line>

<line>We just got to pray that Pierce
is still there. But yeah.</line>

<line>And I'll throw in a hail mary,
we find who wrote this letter.</line>

<line>So this is from , huh?</line>

<line>Interesting.</line>

<line>Well, you can tell from someone's
handwriting who they are?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Gender, age, personality type,</line>

<line>region of origin, pretty much, yeah.</line>

<line>How?</line>

<line>See these looped letters?</line>

<line>Curved forms combined
with medium pressure</line>

<line>are usually indicators of femininity.</line>

<line>Writer was female?</line>

<line>Eh, best guess.</line>

<line>Kinda K.O.'s our theory
of a John as the writer.</line>

<line>So who the hell wrote this letter?</line>

<line>Give me a few hours,
I'll have an answer for you.</line>

<line>What's that tell you?</line>

<line>Ah. Firm.</line>

<line>Logical.</line>

<line>Running from something?</line>

<line>Your grandfather, Pierce mcclintock,
owned this house?</line>

<line>He passed away ten years ago.
I inherited the house from him.</line>

<line>I can't understand what he has
to do with this woman's m*rder.</line>

<line>We don't know either, miss Reilly.</line>

<line>That's why we're here.</line>

<line>He was a good man,
my grandfather.</line>

<line>Not a m*rder*r.</line>

<line>So you'd agree to volunteer your
DNA to prove that?</line>

<line>I don't need to prove that to anyone.</line>

<line>We can get a search warrant.</line>

<line>For what?</line>

<line>An old man's knickknacks?
A dead man's diary?</line>

<line>Pierce kept a diary?</line>

<line>After the fire at Baylor's milk,</line>

<line>Pierce refers to something
called the fifth day in his diary.</line>

<line>The fifth day?
- Mentioned it a bunch of times.</line>

<line>Don't you dare put that in your mouth.</line>

<line>I like cheez whiz on
my cheesesteak. So what?</line>

<line>Fifth day sounds like some
sort of group Pierce started.</line>

<line>Guys from the milk place
injured in the fire.</line>

<line>What'd they do?</line>

<line>Doesn't say.
But check that entry out.</line>

<line>May .</line>

<line>Pierce's milk bottle w*r with Sadie.
He writes about it.</line>

<line>Thing Blanche told us about?</line>

<line>The aftermath...</line>

<line>Delivered to that colored's
boarding house today,</line>

<line>and that flooze just left them
bottles out on the street.</line>

<line>Damn it.</line>

<line>She didn't even pick them up.</line>

<line>Look at that co*n, will you?</line>

<line>Standing there like
she runs the joint.</line>

<line>Fifth day ought to teach her a lesson.</line>

<line>Fifth day is right.
Take that gleam outa that quiff's eye.</line>

<line>Go on, Jonesy.
You show her.</line>

<line>Here's your milk.</line>

<line>So maybe Jonesy was our
evil milkman and not Pierce.</line>

<line>No Jonesy listed as a victim in the fire.</line>

<line>But all them fifth day guys got
messed up in the fire, right?</line>

<line>So how'd Jonesy get involved with them?</line>

<line>And what's he mean the fifth
day ought to teach her a lesson?</line>

<line>Maybe that's what their little club did,</line>

<line>teach lessons to women like Sadie.</line>

<line>Let's check criminal records
for Pierce mcclintock.</line>

<line>Maybe his fifth day activities
made the books.</line>

<line>Any word on the city okaying
the exhumation?</line>

<line>Kite's been in court all day.
- So ask him tonight.</line>

<line>Or tomorrow.</line>

<line>I've called you three times
about this exhumation.</line>

<line>Closing arguments on the wicker job.</line>

<line>Besides, you've ignored
a few of my calls lately, too.</line>

<line>Been busy.</line>

<line>Well there you go.
We're both busy.</line>

<line>Anyway, we got direction on this job.</line>

<line>From ' . / So?</line>

<line>So it's hard to make a case
that the exhumation is pressing,</line>

<line>you know what I mean?</line>

<line>Maybe the judge should meet
the victim's granddaughter.</line>

<line>It's pressing to her.</line>

<line>Look, Fisk hasn't gotten to it,</line>

<line>but I'm guessing you'll need
more probable cause.</line>

<line>The city's strapped for cash.</line>

<line>And this granddaughter
wants answers.</line>

<line>Don't we all.</line>

<line>How're the cats, anyway?
- Good.</line>

<line>Call me.</line>

<line>When you hear from Fisk, I mean.</line>

<line>Sure.</line>

<line>Get anything in criminal records?</line>

<line>Long rap sheet on Pierce.</line>

<line>Assaults on males and females,
all black.</line>

<line>Victims claimed they were att*cked
by a group of young white males.</line>

<line>African american history museum
had a listing of hate groups in ' .</line>

<line>They list the Fifth day as one in Philly.</line>

<line>White supremacists.</line>

<line>Took their name
from the Fifth day of creation.</line>

<line>God said, let us make man in our image</line>

<line>and let him rule over all the earth.</line>

<line>Meaning the white man, of course.</line>

<line>Mission was to terrorize blacks</line>

<line>coming up from
the south looking for jobs.</line>

<line>Every Fifth day,
they'd go on a rampage.</line>

<line>Beat up some black person
for the crime of being alive.</line>

<line>m*rder part of their game?</line>

<line>Could be.
Check it out.</line>

<line>The Fifth day.</line>

<line>Meet Pierce and our friend Jonesy.</line>

<line>Jonesy don't look burned.</line>

<line>Could have them
where the sun don't shine.</line>

<line>Museum didn't have last names
on these clowns.</line>

<line>Id'd them here only by their
monikers or first name.</line>

<line>We'll keep looking.</line>

<line>Lilly still with the ADA?</line>

<line>Our handwriting expert came back
with a profile of the letter writer.</line>

<line>It was a kid.</line>

<line>Only child in the boarding house
was the owner's daughter.</line>

<line>Ten years old at the time
of the m*rder.</line>

<line>I'll go pick up Lil.</line>

<line>This was miss Sadie's favorite room.</line>

<line>My mother took in boarders
during the depression.</line>

<line>I hear this place is a bed
and breakfast now?</line>

<line>Owners say it was okay
for us to come in.</line>

<line>Bring you back to your old home.</line>

<line>I'm glad no one tore it down.</line>

<line>Did you write Sadie's letters here?</line>

<line>I wrote them, yes.</line>

<line>But the words were hers.</line>

<line>Her baby girl meant
the whole world to her.</line>

<line>Do you remember writing about
a milkman who might hurt Sadie?</line>

<line>Jonesy.</line>

<line>I remember him well.</line>

<line>Why?</line>

<line>Because of what Sadie
found in the milk.</line>

<line>Show her who's boss.</line>

<line>Here's your milk.</line>

<line>Nothing but poor white milkman trash.</line>

<line>Who he think he is, trashy ol'...</line>

<line>Poor white milkman trash
left a note, miss Sadie. / Shush, girl.</line>

<line>What's this say?</line>

<line>He says, forgive me.</line>

<line>Crazy White Tr*sh.</line>

<line>He's saying he's sorry.</line>

<line>I still say he trash.</line>

<line>That ain't nothing but tinder for the fire.</line>

<line>Go on, Arletta.</line>

<line>Throw it in.</line>

<line>Wait.</line>

<line>Write something for me.</line>

<line>Why should I?</line>

<line>Because you are a lady.</line>

<line>I forgive you them.</line>

<line>What's your name?</line>

<line>My name is Sadie.</line>

<line>Those notes went on and on
for months,</line>

<line>right till she died.</line>

<line>Why did she think
Jonesy would hurt her?</line>

<line>I think it was her heart, she meant.</line>

<line>Did they exchange notes
the day she was k*lled?</line>

<line>Jonesy wanted her to meet
him here that night.</line>

<line>For a proper visit.</line>

<line>Miss Sadie kept each and every note.</line>

<line>Hid them behind the stove
where no one would look,</line>

<line>and no one ever found them.</line>

<line>Why not?</line>

<line>Because I took them.</line>

<line>Still have them, too.</line>

<line>I was raised by other people, Sadie.</line>

<line>Don't even know my own folks.</line>

<line>Jonesy was an orphan?</line>

<line>Maybe check the children's homes
in the area, look for his name.</line>

<line>I'll care for your little girl,
even if she ain't my own,</line>

<line>because she's like me.</line>

<line>Every child deserves to be loved.</line>

<line>He wanted to make a life with her.</line>

<line>And take her kid in, too.</line>

<line>A real from the Fifth day.</line>

<line>So was Sadie k*lled by the man who
hated her or the man who loved her?</line>

<line>Pierce or Jonesy?</line>

<line>Maybe something happened that night
at the boarding house</line>

<line>that turned the tide of Jonesy's love.</line>

<line>Love can turn on a dime.</line>

<line>We know a candy man?</line>

<line>Do you love me, Sadie,
or do you love the candy man?</line>

<line>Blanche's husband.</line>

<line>Blanche and I, we...</line>

<line>just started dating,</line>

<line>and I, uh...</line>

<line>had a little crush on Sadie.</line>

<line>Don't you do this to me, Manross.</line>

<line>We can talk somewhere else,
if that would make it easier.</line>

<line>I was young...</line>

<line>foolish...</line>

<line>thought I could have my cake
and eat it, too.</line>

<line>Sadie never went for it.</line>

<line>Because she was involved with Jonesy.</line>

<line>So you knew about the affair.
- Not till the night she was k*lled.</line>

<line>They hid it well.</line>

<line>You had to, back then.</line>

<line>If anyone found out,
one of them would be dead.</line>

<line>One of them is dead.</line>

<line>So how'd you find out?</line>

<line>the night of Sadie's m*rder...</line>

<line>We were all supposed to
meet up at the juke joint.</line>

<line>I thought Sadie was going to be
there, but she... she wasn't.</line>

<line>So I went down to the boarding
house to get her.</line>

<line>We got to go tonight, Sadie.</line>

<line>We can't just go.</line>

<line>But we talked about this.</line>

<line>We was just going to visit.</line>

<line>That's what you said in your note.
- I know, but...</line>

<line>Something came up.</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>Look...</line>

<line>you gotta leave with me right now.</line>

<line>I already got the tickets,
the train leaves in a half-hour.</line>

<line>We go now and we could
make it, Sadie. / I want to.</line>

<line>but why's it gotta be tonight?</line>

<line>What's wrong, Jonesy?</line>

<line>I went back to the juke joint.</line>



<line>Never seen her again.</line>

<line>Sadie was asking for trouble taking
up with that half-blind white boy.</line>

<line>What do you mean, half-blind?</line>

<line>Couldn't see out of one eye,
on account of the fire.</line>

<line>Why didn't you ever tell anyone
what you saw that night?</line>

<line>Because I didn't want to hurt...</line>

<line>the woman I love.</line>

<line>But I did, anyway.</line>

<line>Manross volunteered his DNA,
fingerprints, shirt off his back.</line>

<line>You really think this guy's the doer.</line>

<line>Sometimes jealousy beats out
love and hate, hands down.</line>

<line>What I don't get is Jonesy was
just gonna visit Sadie that night,</line>

<line>but then something happens.</line>

<line>And he's frantic to get out of town.</line>

<line>Something like what?</line>

<line>Pierce found out his
white supremacist pal
fell in love with a black woman?</line>

<line>Threatens revenge on them both.</line>

<line>Got our milkman.
Nathan jones.</line>

<line>Just his name, but it's a start.</line>

<line>Grew up in a boys' home in Philly.</line>

<line>Ran him through autotrack, DMV,
even military records.</line>

<line>Got a thousand and one hits back.</line>

<line>Manross said Jonesy was injured
in the fire, went half-blind later.</line>

<line>If he applied for military duty,
he'd have been rejected, right?</line>

<line>Wait a sec. My old man
went through this.</line>

<line>A class F rejection.
Unacceptable for military duty.</line>

<line>Made him feel like he had to wear
a dunce cap, back in the day.</line>

<line>So we check Nathan jones
with F records.</line>

<line>Then maybe we finally nail
down this son of a b*tch.</line>

<line>Hey, rush.</line>

<line>Hi. how'd it go?</line>

<line>Judge Fisk K.O'd
the motion to exhume.</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>Not enough probable cause.</line>

<line>We've got three possible
doers here, Kite.</line>

<line>Look, it's an ancient case, okay?
And the bottom line is cold cash.</line>

<line>We don't have any to spare.</line>

<line>Sorry.</line>

<line>Sarah?</line>

<line>Hi. Any news?</line>

<line>I thought you might want these.</line>

<line>Notes to Sadie from
the milkman in her letter.</line>

<line>She wasn't afraid of him, Sarah,</line>

<line>she was in love with him.</line>

<line>I'll care for your little girl,</line>

<line>even if she ain't my own.</line>

<line>He wanted to take care of her.</line>

<line>And your mother.</line>

<line>I wish she had had a chance to
see this, to, to know this.</line>

<line>Your mom?</line>

<line>I'm sorry.</line>

<line>It's okay.</line>

<line>I have some bad news, too, Sarah.</line>

<line>The D.A.'s office didn't
grant the motion to exhume.</line>

<line>But I'm the family.
Don't I have a say?</line>

<line>It's not that.</line>

<line>They need more of a reason to do it.</line>

<line>Solving my grandmother's m*rder
isn't a good enough reason?</line>

<line>It's complicated.</line>

<line>Financially difficult.</line>

<line>I'll pay for it.</line>

<line>Sarah...</line>

<line>An exhumation and autopsy
cost at least $ , .</line>

<line>I've memorized all of her letters.</line>

<line>These past few days,</line>

<line>I feel as if I've come as close to
meeting my grandmother
as I ever will.</line>

<line>I know how she lived.</line>

<line>But I still need to know how she died.</line>

<line>Body is in an early stage
of dried mummification.</line>

<line>soft tissue.</line>

<line>desiccated down to the bone.</line>

<line>What are the odds on DNA,
Dr. Barnsley?</line>

<line>This is my first year old cadaver.</line>

<line>but DNA can last hundreds of years.</line>

<line>She fought back,
broke three fingernails.</line>

<line>Maybe the doer left a souvenir.</line>

<line>The fingers are in advanced
stage of dehydration, but...</line>

<line>I might be able to
collect some scrapings.</line>

<line>Valens.</line>

<line>You're kidding.</line>

<line>Where?</line>

<line>All right.</line>

<line>Jeffries and Vera found Jonesy.</line>

<line>He's still alive?</line>

<line>And kicking it in New York city.</line>

<line>Detectives, the index finger
of the right hand.</line>

<line>I think maybe we've got something.</line>

<line>Maybe Sadie's speaking
from the grave.</line>

<line>Lab's trying Pierce's DNA
from his granddaughter.</line>

<line>Manross', too.</line>

<line>'s ticket, train to New York.</line>

<line>That's going on the cheap.</line>

<line>Taking SEPTA and New Jersey transit.</line>

<line>We gotta find Amtrak car way back.</line>

<line>take a free hop when we saw her.</line>

<line>Kite pissed you off, uh?</line>

<line>Not fight for the exumation.</line>

<line>It wasn't really his decision though.</line>

<line>Or was it something else with Kite
pissed you off?</line>

<line>I gotta be psychic in an answer outta you?</line>

<line>I, uh,</line>

<line>might've made a mistake.</line>

<line>Rush.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>Thanks, boss.</line>

<line>Manross' cleared.</line>

<line>His DNA didn't match to what was
under Sadie's nails.</line>

<line>So candyman ain't our doer.</line>

<line>Gotta admit it.
Glad for Blanche.</line>

<line>It must be nice to know and get
someone grow old and useless with.</line>

<line>Yeah, it must be.</line>

<line>Grandpa?</line>

<line>You got visitors.</line>

<line>We're here about Sadie douglas,
Mr. Jones.</line>

<line>You remember how she got k*lled?</line>

<line>r*ped, suffocated.</line>

<line>Hey. What are you saying to him?</line>

<line>Never mind.</line>

<line>Frankie, why don't you go watch  TV?</line>

<line>You didn't finish your soup, grandpa.</line>

<line>I'm done, Frankie.</line>

<line>Go on.</line>

<line>Yeah...</line>

<line>I remember how she died.</line>

<line>Cops back then said it was a John.</line>

<line>Oh, no, she wasn't a prost*tute.</line>

<line>She lived in that house
because she had to.</line>

<line>Times were rough back then.</line>

<line>She didn't make her living hustling?</line>

<line>Sadie was a lady.</line>

<line>I gave her some money
from time to time.</line>

<line>Of course, she couldn't tell anybody</line>

<line>where she was getting it from.</line>

<line>Times being what they were.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>And you being in love.</line>

<line>Who the hell is Sadie?</line>

<line>You know, her...</line>

<line>her little girl ought to know
that her mama was a lady.</line>

<line>She's dead.</line>

<line>Sadie's daughter.</line>

<line>Night of Sadie's m*rder,</line>

<line>you wanted her to leave town with you.</line>

<line>Why?</line>

<line>Because they were coming.</line>

<line>Who?</line>

<line>Them.</line>

<line>They were coming.</line>

<line>So then, I says to her,
you may look almost white,</line>

<line>but you is black as midnight.</line>

<line>Jonesy over there don't think I'm funny.</line>

<line>Oh, that's because he's giving
her his morning milk.</line>

<line>Time that b*tch got a real taste
of white man's milk.</line>

<line>Yeah, sure.</line>

<line>Ain't that right, Jonesy?</line>

<line>Damn right. / Yeah!</line>

<line>Fifth day's rolling, boys.</line>

<line>Tonight!</line>

<line>Tonight!</line>

<line>Sadie?</line>

<line>Sadie!</line>

<line>Sadie!</line>

<line>I tried to save her,</line>

but she wouldn't go.
<line>I begged her, but she wouldn't go.</line>

<line>And I left.</line>

<line>A man loves a woman...</line>

<line>and leaves her to that?</line>

<line>All this was forever ago.
Why you care now?</line>

<line>Because a woman died,</line>

<line>and a family wants to know why.</line>

<line>And because what happens
in the past</line>

<line>never really goes away, does it?</line>

<line>No. It don't.</line>

<line>My grandpa didn't do nothing.</line>

<line>Would you volunteer your DNA
to prove that?</line>

<line>We got a sister lab here in New York.</line>

<line>It'll take a few minutes
to run your DNA.</line>

<line>And we can go right now.</line>

<line>He'll do it.</line>

<line>Right, grandpa?</line>

<line>I'll get your coat.
He didn't do nothing.</line>

<line>We'll settle this whole thing
in four or five minutes, Mr. Jones.</line>

<line>Lab's got a process called, uh,</line>

<line>electronic DNA sampling.
EDS for short.</line>

<line>Zaps your DNA through the internet.</line>

<line>Compares it with what we found
under Sadie's fingernails.</line>

<line>Finds a match.</line>

<line>Unless you want to skip the trip
and tell us what really happened?</line>

<line>If you have the question, ask it.</line>

<line>Thought I just did.</line>

<line>Come on, grandpa.</line>

<line>I'm ready.</line>

<line>Go ahead and ask your question.</line>

<line>What happened night
Sadie was k*lled?</line>

<line>You gotta leave with me now.</line>

<line>Look, I already got the tickets.
Train leaves in half an hour.</line>

<line>We go now, we can make it, Sadie.</line>

<line>I want to, but why
it gotta be tonight?</line>

<line>What's wrong, Jonesy?</line>

<line>We gotta go.</line>

<line>The train to New York is...
- New York?</line>

<line>But my daughter lives in Virginia.</line>

<line>We'll send for her.</line>

<line>You promised we was gonna be
a family together.</line>

<line>We will, but we gotta go now.</line>

<line>What about her?</line>

<line>What about her, Jonesy?</line>

<line>That's, uh...</line>

<line>that's your daughter?</line>

<line>You promised to care for her
like she was your own, remember?</line>

<line>Because every child deserve loving,
you said.</line>

<line>You, uh...</line>

<line>never showed me that before.</line>

<line>Why won't you look at her, Jonesy?</line>

<line>You and me,</line>

<line>we can make it together,</line>

<line>because no one'll know, Sadie.
No one'll know what you are.</line>

<line>You barely look it, Sadie,
and you can pass.</line>

<line>Shut up!</line>

<line>She can't pass but you can.</line>

<line>And we can have a life together
and no one'll ever know.</line>

<line>Shut up!</line>

<line>Because I love you, Sadie.</line>

<line>I love you.</line>

<line>No. You don't.</line>

<line>Just told me so.</line>

<line>Well, look at what we got here.</line>

<line>Jonesy's getting a leg
up on us, boys.</line>

<line>Ain't you, Jonesy?</line>

<line>Jonesy!</line>

<line>Let her be, Jonesy.</line>

<line>What's wrong with her?</line>

<line>Get up!</line>

<line>Hey, I said get up!</line>

<line>Sadie...</line>

<line>Sadie...</line>

<line>Sadie was a lady.</line></xml>
