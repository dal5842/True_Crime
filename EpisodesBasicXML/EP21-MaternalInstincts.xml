<line>What's up?</line>

<line>You know Lindesy Dunlay?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Court-appointed child psychologist,
I went to high school with her.</line>

<line>Oh, yeah? What she want with us?</line>

<line>Case of hers. Sean Morgan was
arrested for a strong-arm.</line>

<line>Judge sent him to Lindsey for evaluation.</line>

<line>And?</line>

<line>When he was three, Sean
witnessed his mother's m*rder.</line>

<line>The case was never solved. / Lil!</line>

<line>Hey, Lindsey. / Hey.</line>

<line>It's my partner Scotty Valens.</line>

<line>How you doing? / Good.</line>

<line>So, uh, what was she like in high school?</line>

<line>She'll never tell, right?</line>

<line>Let's just say Lilly and I
never made the year book.</line>

<line>The holy terror is over there.</line>

<line>What's his deal?</line>

-<line>year-old thug in the making.</line>

<line>Sean came up in foster care?</line>

<line>I'm hoping the judge goes easy,</line>

'<line>cause in another year
he gets the big time.</line>

<line>What was the robbery?</line>

<line>Purse snatching off an LOL.</line>

<line>Done two others just like it.</line>

<line>He's next to hopeless.</line>

<line>But it seems like he has some real
memories of his mom getting k*lled.</line>

<line>That's why I called you.</line>

<line>He never told anyone about it?</line>

<line>No one that believed him.</line>

<line>Sean, this is Detective Rush
who I told you about.</line>

<line>My partner Detective Valens.</line>

<line>Partners, huh?</line>

<line>You hit that yet?</line>

<line>I know I just misunderstood you, Sean.</line>

<line>I'm about to turn .</line>

<line>If he don't man-up real soon,
maybe you and I could hook it up.</line>

<line>Yeah, yeah, I'll think about it.</line>

<line>Sean, stop wasting their time
and tell them about your mom.</line>

<line>Lindesy said you had some specific
memories about her being k*lled?</line>

<line>I forget 'em.</line>

<line>So you like stealing from old
ladies, huh? That's impressive.</line>

<line>What do you know about it, smalls?</line>

<line>I know I got better things to do that
monkey with a kid trying to get attention.</line>

<line>Let's bounce.</line>

<line>I'm sorry, I thought this kid was different.</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>You get ignored all the time, right?</line>

<line>Treated like what you say
either ain't true or worth crap.</line>

<line>Yeah, that's about it.</line>

<line>And here come two people who want
to listen to what you have to say</line>

<line>and you're letting us walk away?</line>

<line>You want your mom's case
looked at, we're your chance.</line>

<line>Why should I believe you?</line>

<line>Look at me.</line>

<line>Am I lying?</line>

<line>Red and yellow balloons.</line>

<line>A train and the name "Bobby".</line>

<line>That's what I remember
about her being m*rder*d.</line>

<line>Rebecca Morgan.</line>

<line>A -year-old waitress.</line>

<line>Stabbed to death in her
rowhouse in Mayfair.</line>

<line>No w*apon recorvered.</line>

<line>Got some prints, hair, but never a match.</line>

<line>Lady was butchered real good.</line>

<line>Gaping neck wound.</line>

<line>Three-year-old Sean sat
with her all night like that.</line>

<line>No wonder he's a little s.o.b.</line>

<line>Who found the body?</line>

<line>Neighbor. Leon Kincaid.</line>

<line>Up early for a jog, heard
the kid wailing, called .</line>

<line>Suspects?</line>

<line>She worked as a cocktail waitress
at a joint called Boilermakers.</line>

<line>Ton of interviews from there.</line>

<line>Patrons, co-workers--- nothing stuck.</line>

<line>Jeffries is running the names again.</line>

<line>Maybe years later someone's
true colors have come through.</line>

<line>Anything on Sean's father?</line>

<line>The assigned's notebook says
he was never in the picture.</line>

<line>No next of kin, landing Sean in foster care...</line>

<line>leaving us with red and yellow balloons,</line>

<line>a train and the name Bobby.</line>

<line>Pretty modest starting point.</line>

<line>Any luck for us?</line>

<line>Yeah. Your caller, Leon Kincaid,
the guy's on the books.</line>

<line>What'd he do?</line>

<line>Well, starting in ' , been arrested
for open lewdeness, loitering,</line>

<line>and my personal favorite,
prowling at night.</line>

<line>Any idea where Leon
hangs out these days?</line>

<line>Yeah, he happens to be the top man
at the Germantown Dorsett Bank.</line>

<line>Leon Kincaid?</line>

<line>Detectives Rush and Valens.
Can we have a minute?</line>

<line>Um... Okay.</line>

<line>I'll be right back, Jodie.</line>

<line>This way.</line>

<line>About : a.m.</line>

<line>I'm out running and hear
the kid bawling his head off,</line>

<line>so I go aroung the back</line>

<line>and look in, and, uh...
it was just awful.</line>

<line>Did you know Rebecca?</line>

<line>Enough to say hello, that's about it.</line>

<line>Ever see anyone go in
or out of her house?</line>

<line>Nah.</line>

<line>Pretty girl, right?</line>

<line>I guess.</line>

<line>Ever ask her out?</line>

<line>Like I said, we never really spoke, so, uh...</line>

<line>I'm sorry, I'm not much help.</line>

<line>Uh, but I should get back.</line>

<line>To Jodie?</line>

<line>Pardon?</line>

<line>Need to get back so he can look over
her shoulder, down her blouse.</line>

<line>Busty girl.</line>

<line>We know about you, Leon.</line>

<line>We know you've had your
trouble with boundaries.</line>

<line>I never hurt anyone.</line>

<line>I never touched.</line>

<line>Did my probation, got counseling.</line>

<line>Good for you.</line>

<line>But in ' , you were just getting revved up.</line>

<line>Hey, Leon, you registered
as a sex offender?</line>

<line>No, hell no. I never molested anyone.</line>

<line>Still, maybe I'll talk to sex
crimes see what we can do</line>

<line>about getting you on the books.</line>

<line>Yeah, 'cause this sheep
dresses up real good.</line>

<line>Better get the word out.</line>

<line>Oh, jeez, okay. Okay.</line>

<line>I'd peep on Rebecca.</line>

<line>Pretty regular?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>How about the night she died?</line>

<line>But I didn't k*ll her.</line>

<line>Ned, is something wrong?</line>

<line>I wanted to apologize for earlier.</line>

<line>You don't have to say anything.</line>

<line>Just...</line>

<line>well, the ball's in your court, okay?</line>

<line>Okay. Thank you.</line>

<line>One more thing.</line>

<line>What's all this?</line>

<line>For Sean, for his birthday.</line>

<line>Hey, these are for you, little man.</line>

<line>There you go.</line>

<line>Ned, don't give him any gifts.</line>

<line>Oh, every boy needs something
to open on his birthday.</line>

<line>We have cake, that's enough.</line>

<line>Oh, here.</line>

<line>This is gonna be just like the Pampers.</line>

<line>Oh, no, no, no.
I take back what I said earlier.</line>

<line>I've written everything down.
I'm going to write you a check.</line>

<line>What, so it can bounce?</line>

<line>Here you go.</line>

<line>Red and yellow balloons.</line>

<line>Like Sean remembered.</line>

<line>So, Leon, that's all you saw?</line>

<line>I wasn't exactly pumped to stick around
for a three-year-old's birthday party.</line>

<line>Right. No girl coming out of cake.</line>

<line>Where's the upside for the
guy standing in the hedge?</line>

<line>At least my move wasn't handling
out Pampers and balloons.</line>

<line>This Ned guy's a complete stooge.</line>

<line>Ned Ryan.</line>

<line>The write-up here says you
told the assigned detective</line>

<line>you hadn't seen Rebecca in over a week.</line>

<line>Been so long now.</line>

<line>I couldn't tell you when
I talked to Rebecca last.</line>

<line>Well, how about the night
she was m*rder*d?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Ned, we know you were at Rebecca's
shortly before it happened.</line>

<line>And you came bearing gifts; balloons.</line>

<line>So don't lie about it like you
did the first time around.</line>

<line>Maybe... I was there.</line>

<line>But I left after a few minutes.</line>

<line>But you were angry, right?</line>

<line>So maybe you did a U-turn.</line>

<line>Yeah, 'cause you and Rebecca
fought earlier that day, too.</line>

<line>Rebecca was a regular at the store.</line>

<line>I felt bad for her-- struggling
to support Sean on her own.</line>

<line>You were giving her Pampers.</line>

<line>Yes, I'd slip her Pampers,
baby food-- to cut her a break.</line>

<line>Thanks so much, Ned.</line>

<line>Not a problem.</line>

<line>I just added another shift at the tavern,</line>

so it won't be long before
<line>I'm on my own two feet.</line>

<line>I wish you were working
less at that bar, not more.</line>

<line>A woman like you in such a filthy place...</line>

<line>it's not right.</line>

<line>Well, you're a doll, but it's a real
blessing to have more work.</line>

<line>Thanks again, Ned.</line>

<line>Oh, Ned...</line>

<line>Oh, Ned, I'm sorry.</line>

<line>I'm just not the kind of gal who
casually necks with a man.</line>

<line>Rebecca, I didn't mean it like that.</line>

<line>I would like to kiss you,</line>

<line>because what I have to say
is anything but casual.</line>

<line>But you barely know me.</line>

<line>My folks dated one
evening at a county fair</line>

<line>to know that they would spend
the next years together.</line>

<line>Oh, Ned.</line>

<line>You need a man in the house.</line>

<line>A father figure to Sean.</line>

<line>There's already a man in my life.</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>Who?</line>

<line>And where is he?</line>

<line>He's from before -- back in Virginia.</line>

<line>Well, how could he allow
you to be here alone?</line>

<line>It's just all mixed up.</line>

<line>It's upside-down.</line>

<line>I'm sorry, Ned.</line>

<line>This just isn't proper airing
these personal matters.</line>

<line>I guess I would have figured
it all out soon enough, huh?</line>

<line>Yeah, Sean's three today.</line>

<line>I guess he won't be needing
boxes and boxes and boxes</line>

<line>of Pampers too much longer!</line>

<line>So you felt rejected.</line>

<line>No, no, no. I felt horrible
for blowing up like that.</line>

<line>And that night, when I goofed
again, I left... for good.</line>

<line>Where were you the rest of the night?</line>

<line>I lived in an apartment building at the time.</line>

<line>Whether anyone saw me,
can vouch for me, I wouldn't know.</line>

<line>Okay, Ned.</line>

<line>We'll look into it.</line>

<line>I just wanted to find a gal like
my mother... from a better time.</line>

<line>Rebecca was that girl.</line>

<line>Ned's story checks out.</line>

<line>An old coot at the Tree Lane Apartment</line>

<line>knew all about his pining for Rebecca.</line>

<line>What, he see him the night of the m*rder?</line>

<line>Coot says Ned was on his
balcony for hours that night</line>

<line>letting balloons go one by one.</line>

<line>Time to shift focus to this man in her life.</line>

<line>Well, maybe the man in
her life was Sean's dad.</line>

<line>Maybe that was Bobby.</line>

<line>Got something?</line>

<line>Autotracked Rebecca Morgan</line>

<line>looking for that connection back in Virginia.</line>

<line>Rebecca Morgan...</line>

<line>died in .</line>

<line>Four years before Sean was even born.</line>

<line>Rebecca Morgan was a
-year-old freshman at Virginia.</line>

<line>Died in a car crash in .</line>

<line>So who was Sean's mom
and why she using an alias?</line>

<line>Woman goes into hiding,
she's usually running from abuse.</line>

<line>Abuser could be the man in her life.</line>

<line>She told Ned she was in
a mixed-up relationship.</line>

"<line>Upside down."</line>

<line>Someone who wasn't around.</line>

<line>Maybe why he wasn't around.</line>

<line>Brings us back to,
she was probably on the run.</line>

<line>So let's figure out who "she" is.</line>

<line>Start with the ME's office, Scotty.</line>

<line>They should have her
fingerprints to run through AFIS.</line>

<line>You get her name, buzz me.</line>

<line>I'm going to go see Sean.</line>

<line>So how's Elisa?</line>

<line>Good. She liked meeting you.</line>

<line>Coming to first Thursdays.</line>

<line>She someone serious?</line>

<line>We were engaged.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Before everything happened.</line>

<line>Well, maybe you'll get it back.</line>

<line>I'm hoping.</line>

<line>I'm not supposed to have girls up here.</line>

<line>It's my foster parent's rules.</line>

<line>Sean, the red and yellow balloons,
they meant something.</line>

<line>That's supposed to make me feel better?</line>

<line>Tell me more about the train, and Bobby.</line>

<line>I'm not even sure the train was real.</line>

<line>Maybe a toy train?</line>

<line>No, it was a sketch,
a drawing or something.</line>

<line>That's it, that's all I got.</line>

<line>Sean, I think your mom
was running from someone.</line>

<line>Yeah? Like who?</line>

<line>I'm not sure.</line>

<line>In fact, I'm not sure who your mom was.</line>

<line>Rebecca Morgan.</line>

<line>No, that's the name she was going
by, but she was someone else.</line>

<line>Soap opera city.</line>

<line>She was trying to get
away from something.</line>

<line>Let me tell you the , okay?</line>

<line>Solve my mom's case or don't.</line>

'<line>Cause I could give a flying
middle finger, okay?</line>

<line>So why have Lindsey contact me?</line>

'<line>Cause I was bored.</line>

<line>And now I'm bored again.</line>

<line>You're not doing it for me anymore.</line>

<line>You're too pushy.</line>

<line>So how about the hearing you got
coming up-- that bore you, too?</line>

<line>You're .</line>

<line>The judge dosen't have to
treat you like a kid, you know?</line>

<line>The judge can show up with
no drawers under his robe.</line>

<line>He can also kiss my a*s.</line>

<line>That's a smart attitude.</line>

<line>Rush.</line>

<line>Yeah. Okay.</line>

<line>Bye.</line>

<line>Wanna know your mom's real name?</line>

<line>No thanks.</line>

<line>When did my daughter die?</line>

.

<line>I'm sorry to hear that.</line>

<line>Care for a drink?</line>

<line>No, no, thank you.</line>

<line>I'll be truthful.</line>

<line>Having Linda was the worst thing
that ever happened to me.</line>

<line>She was a bad kid?</line>

<line>Not so bad. I just never took to her.</line>

<line>No matter how you slice it,</line>

<line>for years you lose your life.</line>

<line>I know I wasn't maternal.</line>

<line>Everyone kept saying, "when
she pops out, you'll feel different."</line>

<line>Well, guess what?</line>

<line>Miss Frandsen, do you remember
the last time you saw Linda?</line>

<line>Guess the spring of ' ?</line>

<line>What was the occasion?</line>

<line>Vic.</line>

<line>Her ex-husband.</line>

<line>We weren't aware she had a husband.</line>

<line>Well, they didn't walk down the aisle,</line>

<line>but for all intents and purpose...</line>

<line>And so Linda showed up here?</line>

<line>Unannounced.</line>

<line>It'd been three years
since I last saw her.</line>

<line>I wasn't even aware
she'd gotten pregnant.</line>

<line>His name's Sean.</line>

<line>Finally got your wish, huh?</line>

<line>Yeah, and he's been so healthy.</line>

<line>Happy to hear it.</line>

<line>Why are you here?</line>

<line>Vic's a freak.</line>

<line>It's one thing if he wants to punch
on me, but I won't let him hurt Sean.</line>

<line>Here we go.</line>

<line>Here we go what?</line>

<line>If he's as bad as you claim he is,</line>

<line>go to the police,
get a restraining order.</line>

<line>All that'll do is help make for
a tearjerker on the : news.</line>

<line>Sure that's not the drama
queen coming out?</line>

<line>Don't you dare do that, Mama.</line>

<line>So what?</line>

<line>You don't wanna go to the police,
what am I supposed to do?</line>

<line>Let us stay here with you.</line>

<line>One night, then we'll leave
and I'll be out of your hair forever.</line>

<line>Linda and Sean were on the road early.</line>

<line>What about Vic?</line>

<line>He ever come around?</line>

<line>No. Didn't call either.</line>

<line>I'm sure he didn't expect me
to know where she was.</line>

<line>You never heard from Linda again?</line>

<line>Nope.</line>

<line>I always figured they were
still out there somewhere.</line>

<line>Hey, Rocky... relax.</line>

<line>How was she m*rder*d?</line>

<line>We'll get to that.</line>

<line>Linda's mom says she
was on the run from you.</line>

<line>Well, that's wrong. I never met her mom.</line>

<line>Not that I didn't want to.</line>

<line>Linda wouldn't let that happen?</line>

<line>She had a lot of rules.</line>

<line>She has one against marriage?</line>

<line>She said a piece of paper's
what ruined things.</line>

<line>I disagreed.</line>

<line>So LInda keeps pulling that kind of
nonsense, why keep her around?</line>

'<line>Cause my life was different with her.</line>

<line>Ton of smiles.</line>

<line>Vic, you front like this big, gentle giant,
but you know what... I don't buy it.</line>

'<line>Cause we've been here five minutes</line>

<line>and not once have you
asked about your son.</line>

<line>My son?</line>

<line>Sean.</line>

<line>Is that Linda's son?</line>

'<line>Cause it wasn't my son.</line>

<line>Linda's only dream was to have a baby.</line>

<line>I couldn't give her one.</line>

<line>sh**ting blanks.</line>

<line>Thanks for that.</line>

<line>I failed her in the biggest way.</line>

<line>What? Horse, why you smiling?</line>

'<line>Cause we're going to get a pony.</line>

<line>Vic, what?</line>

<line>I went to the adoption agency
today, got us an appointment.</line>

<line>Oh, no.</line>

<line>I thought that'd make you happy.</line>

<line>They're not going to
approve our application.</line>

<line>You don't know. Might get lucky.</line>

<line>We're not going to get lucky.
You've been out of work too long.</line>

<line>That'll change.</line>

'<line>Cause it is time to
play less and work more.</line>

<line>Hey, we'll slow down.</line>

<line>Better yet, we'll get married.</line>

<line>Huh?</line>

<line>Yeah, it'll increase our chances.</line>

<line>Baby, what's wrong?</line>

<line>I'm pregnant.</line>

<line>I didn't think I could make that happen.</line>

<line>It's not yours, Horse.</line>

<line>Horse, I'm sorry.</line>

<line>I'm so sorry, Horse.</line>

<line>I'm sorry.</line>

<line>Tried talking to her,
I thought we could work it out.</line>

<line>I come home one night from
job hunting, she was gone.</line>

<line>And when was this?</line>

<line>It was April in ' .</line>

<line>You know who the father was?</line>

<line>Found a name written down once.</line>

<line>Had a hunch he was the guy.</line>

<line>Any chance the name was Bobby?</line>

<line>No. Silver.</line>

<line>Kyle... Silver.</line>

<line>Not a period of my life I was so proud of.</line>

<line>No?</line>

<line>I'm married years.</line>

<line>Linda was my one transgression.</line>

<line>My wife almost divorced me.</line>

<line>Pregnancy didn't go over
real big at home, huh?</line>

<line>That part was never a problem.</line>

<line>Linda had a miscarriage.</line>

<line>Miscarriage?</line>

<line>Caught the biggest break of my life.</line>

<line>I mean, an affair is one thing, but...</line>

<line>a second family-- that only plays in Utah.</line>

<line>That was it then?</line>

<line>As far as you know, Linda
moved on to someone else?</line>

<line>I wouldn't say she went quietly.</line>

<line>Nor was it easy for me to say good-bye.</line>

<line>Why not?</line>

<line>Because this girl was
so sexy that it was sily.</line>

<line>Kyle.</line>

<line>What are you doing here?</line>

<line>Let me put my tongue in your mouth.</line>

<line>Are you out of your mind?
I asked you not to come here.</line>

<line>Everybody's looking at us.</line>

"<line>Who's the piece with Silver?
Is he doing her?"</line>

<line>You love it. / Stop it.</line>

<line>I'm telling you, this is not the right way.</line>

<line>That's too bad.</line>

<line>- 'Cause I'm not giving up.
- What are you doing? Linda.</line>

<line>Linda...</line>

<line>You know this is how you want it.</line>

<line>Linda...</line>

<line>Don't you?</line>

<line>Don't you? / Linda.</line>

<line>Yes. Yes. Yes.</line>

<line>I'm not giving up, baby.</line>

<line>I can't do it this way. / Come on.</line>

<line>I'm sorry.</line>

<line>For the last time.</line>

<line>This is all wrong.</line>

<line>I walked back to my office
and never saw her again.</line>

<line>And sexually speaking,
this is how Linda was?</line>

<line>Overt like that?</line>

<line>Well, I guess that makes
two secrets I've kept.</line>

<line>I mean, if my wife knew the particulars,
she never would have forgiven me.</line>

<line>Hospital records confirm, Linda
had a miscarriage September ' .</line>

<line>Sean was born October ' .</line>

<line>She had to have gotten pregnant fast.</line>

<line>Well, after hearing Silver's account of Linda</line>

<line>that would have taken her all of an hour.</line>

<line>Question is, do you believe
Silver's version of Linda</line>

<line>or ex-husband Vic's?</line>

<line>Or Neds?</line>

<line>Mm. Three different girls.</line>

<line>Or three girls in one.</line>

<line>There she is--</line>

best and brightest physician
<line>in all of Philadelphia.</line>

<line>Shut up, Vailens.</line>

<line>It's Valens. V-a-l-e-n-s.</line>

<line>Hey, Frannie. Thanks for coming so late.</line>

<line>What else am I doing at : at night?</line>

<line>Our victim had a miscarriage shortly
before getting pregnant a second time.</line>

<line>Yeah, we're determining a timeline</line>

<line>for when the actual roo-roo took place.</line>

<line>This is Rebecca Morgan,
now Linda Frandsen case?</line>

<line>No. According to the autopsy,</line>

<line>there's no indication of striation
in the bone structure of her pelvis.</line>

<line>Come again?</line>

<line>Your victim never gave birth at all.</line>

<line>Linda's autopsy shows
she never dilievered a baby.</line>

<line>Sean wasn't hers.</line>

<line>She was in no position to adopt.</line>

<line>We contact the Center For
Missing and Abused Children?</line>

<line>Ran a search on abducted children</line>

<line>in the Virginia, mid-Atlantic states,
' to ' .</line>

<line>Two possible matches :</line>

<line>John Barrett of Aberdeen, Maryland,
Robert Gordon, Richmon, Virginia.</line>

<line>Robert?</line>

<line>Bobby.</line>

<line>Gordons could be Sean's real parents.</line>

<line>Don't float that till you're sure, Scotty.</line>

<line>I'll contact Virginia. They'll
have the Gordon's DNA on file.</line>

<line>I'll call over and get Sean to get a DNA
swab, say it's part of the investigation.</line>

<line>As soon as you get a match, heads out.</line>

<line>You say Bobby's been
in several foster homes?</line>

<line>Moved a lot.</line>

<line>He's had it rough.</line>

<line>Been arrested?</line>

<line>Jeff, don't assume that.</line>

<line>A bunch of foster homes -- come on.</line>

<line>Am I right?</line>

<line>Several times.</line>

<line>For what?</line>

<line>Assaults, theft.</line>

<line>But so far, the juvenile
courts have bailed him out.</line>

<line>Mr. and Mrs. Gordon,</line>

ever known someone
<line>named Linda Frandsen?</line>

<line>She the one who took our boy?</line>

<line>Frandsen? Wasn't that what's
his name ex-wife, the landscaper?</line>

<line>Hector?</line>

<line>Victor.</line>

<line>Lake?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Linda came by with him once.</line>

<line>What a sweetie!</line>

<line>How old is he?</line>

<line>Ten months.</line>

<line>What's his name?</line>

<line>Bobby.</line>

<line>Bobby!</line>

<line>You're just a little miracle,
aren't you, Bobby?</line>

<line>That's what I tell myself as I'm
combing the Cheerios out of my hair.</line>

<line>Can I tell you a secret? / Sure.</line>

<line>I'm expecting.</line>

<line>That's wonderful.</line>

<line>I think it's a boy.</line>

<line>She seemed lovely.</line>

<line>They came off decent enough.</line>

<line>Yeah, we know Vic.</line>

<line>When can we see Bobby?</line>

<line>He goes by "Sean" now.</line>

<line>And he doesn't know about you yet,</line>

<line>but Child Services will be
in touch to facilitate things.</line>

<line>Will you tell him that we miss
him and we want to see him.</line>

<line>Why?</line>

<line>Why what?</line>

<line>You came here because you
want to solve her m*rder?</line>

<line>Why? To hell with her.</line>

<line>How'd it go?</line>



<line>He's getting another chance.</line>

<line>But if he so much as jaywalks during
probation, Judge Haze will look him up.</line>

<line>So, you want to do girl's night soon?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Of course, if you'd rather go
fly a kite, I'd understand.</line>

<line>Who you been talking to?</line>

<line>Oh, man, my shadow again.</line>

<line>You caught a break today, huh?</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>You did, Sean.</line>

<line>Don't screw it up.</line>

<line>Thank you for your advice.</line>

<line>Her name was Linda Fransen.</line>

<line>I told you I could give a heave-ho.</line>

<line>She kidnapped you when you were two.</line>

<line>Man, you keep trying to shock
me and you keep missing.</line>

<line>I'm just giving you the straight story.</line>

<line>Here's the rest :</line>

<line>we found your parents.</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Mom and Dad?</line>

<line>I got a bunch of brothers and sisters, too?</line>

<line>Two brothers.</line>

<line>You know what?</line>

<line>You can have 'em.</line>

<line>They don't want me, they want you.</line>

<line>You talk to 'em?</line>

<line>They want to meet you.</line>

<line>I bet.</line>

<line>They got to be thrilled their
kid's a juvie delinquent.</line>

<line>Sean, you got a family waiting for you.</line>

<line>I don't want a family.</line>

<line>I would have settled to have
one parent looking out for me.</line>

<line>Here you got two and you're snubbing it?</line>

<line>I didn't realize you were such a hothead.</line>

<line>Sean, you can be the kind of
kid they want, or be a thug.</line>

<line>It's up to you.</line>

<line>Snatching babies, huh, Vic?</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>Thought you'd work the
old razzle-dazzle on us,</line>

<line>send us to Dr. Silver
and the trail would end there.</line>

<line>But it didn't.</line>

<line>I'm sorry. You fellows are losing me.</line>

<line>It led to your old employers, the Gordons.</line>

<line>Yeah, where you and Linda stole a baby.</line>

<line>Come on.</line>

<line>And afterwards, we're thinking
Linda must have ditched you.</line>

<line>Yeah, that's why you looked
her up, to wipe her out.</line>

<line>I want a lawyer.</line>

<line>We'll get you a judge and jury, too.</line>

<line>You do that, 'cause I didn't k*ll her.</line>

<line>Say we're in the jury box
and we're eyeballing Vic here.</line>

<line>We know he's a kidnapper.</line>

<line>I didn't do that.</line>

<line>You ain't going to beat that one, Vic.</line>

<line>That'd be a one-in-a-million shot.</line>

<line>Think about how whupped
he was by this Linda,</line>

<line>so much he swiped a baby for her.</line>

<line>Did a federal crime for his lady</line>

<line>and she gives you the high hat?</line>

<line>I see motive, real clear.</line>

<line>Oh, yeah.</line>

<line>Who do you think the jury's
going to put the m*rder on?</line>

<line>I did not do m*rder.</line>

<line>Okay. Good luck with that.</line>

<line>I didn't.</line>

<line>I only ripped off the kid.</line>

<line>After Linda lost that other yo-yo's
baby, she come back to me.</line>

<line>I wanted her to stay.</line>

<line>I said I'd do anything.</line>

<line>What'd she say?</line>

"<line>Prove it."</line>

<line>Anyone see you?</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>Calm down. Calm... Look at me.</line>

<line>Hand him over.</line>

<line>Give me my boy.</line>

<line>Scoot over, I'll drive.</line>

<line>No, darling, you got to get back.</line>

<line>Finish your work.</line>

<line>I can't go back. I'm nervous.</line>

<line>Horse, you're such my baby, too.</line>

<line>You go on. You be strong for me, okay?</line>

<line>In a few hours, you'll be
seeing us at the motel.</line>

<line>Go on.</line>

<line>Go on.</line>

<line>I got back to the motel that
night, she'd cleared out.</line>

<line>Just like that?</line>

<line>She left a note.</line>

<line>Said she's going to Philly
to find us new haunts.</line>

<line>That she'd send for me.</line>

<line>Meanwhile, I'm supposed to keep
clocking in over at the Gordon's.</line>

<line>Never got the call, huh?</line>

<line>Weeks turned into years.</line>

<line>Who else knew she came to Philadelphia?</line>

<line>A few years later, I told this guy</line>

<line>that'd come around asking
questions about her.</line>

<line>What guy?</line>

<line>A private investigator.</line>

<line>P.I. say what he wanted with Linda?</line>

<line>No, I didn't push it.</line>

<line>I was pretty torqued off by then.</line>

<line>I told him, "Hey, she's somewhere in Philly."</line>

<line>Vic copped to the kidnapping,
not the m*rder.</line>

<line>You believe him?</line>

<line>Linda humiliate him pretty good.</line>

<line>Made a fool of Ned, too.</line>

<line>Seems like that was kind of the
way she walked through life.</line>

<line>Got a trail of guys behind her she duped.</line>

<line>Eventually, one of 'em didn't sit still for it.</line>

<line>The P.I. who approached Vic was a
weasel by the name of Isiah Bagley.</line>

<line>Did he say who worked for?</line>

<line>You'r gonna love this. Dr. Kyle Silver.</line>

<line>Homicide.</line>

<line>Why's a doctor hire a P.I.?</line>

<line>Thought he was glad she split.</line>

<line>Bagley said he wanted
her found at any cost.</line>

<line>Okay, thanks.</line>

<line>That was your friend Lindsey.</line>

<line>Sean just got picked up for stealing a car.</line>

<line>My lawyer says I could get two years.</line>

<line>I heard.</line>

<line>So I'm supposed to sit
in this joint for two years?</line>

<line>You stole a car and you were drunk.</line>

<line>Three beers.</line>

<line>Drunk driving can lead to homicide</line>

<line>and homicide leads to jail
for the rest of your life.</line>

<line>So I get it.</line>

<line>You're as full of it as
everyone else. / Sean...</line>

<line>what is it that you want?</line>

<line>Right now, to get up out of here.</line>

<line>Say you're out...</line>

<line>the foster homes, too.</line>

<line>Then what?</line>

<line>I'm on the run and I'm not looking back.</line>

<line>You taking anyone with you?</line>

<line>A girl?</line>

<line>Nah.</line>

<line>I'm going to meet my woman.</line>

<line>Someone who doesn't know you.</line>

<line>Make a fresh start.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>And me and her gonna
settle down, kick back</line>

<line>and make a lot of love.</line>

<line>Be careful.</line>

<line>Nah, no jimmies for me.</line>

<line>I want kids.</line>

<line>I'm gonna have of them.</line>

<line>What are you gonna do for work?</line>

<line>Whatever. I don't know.</line>

<line>mouths do feed and you don't know?</line>

<line>So not .</line>

<line>Maybe just one.</line>

<line>Make it a girl.</line>

<line>So what happens when your little girl</line>

<line>comes home with a purple foot?</line>

<line>Why would she get a purple foot?</line>

<line>Because it's winter time
and you got no job,</line>

<line>your wife has new guy</line>

<line>and your daughter's
got holes in her shoses.</line>

<line>Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- No, answer me,</line>

<line>what are you gonna do?</line>

<line>What are you gonna do?</line>

<line>So you're saying I got no right
to want anything in this life?</line>

<line>No, no, no, you can have it all.</line>

<line>But you're gonna need help.</line>

<line>How would you know what I need?</line>

<line>Because I wanted everything, too.</line>

<line>But I was too damned proud to
ask for help for way too long.</line>

<line>Good luck, okay.</line>

<line>I did wanna meet my family.</line>

<line>Silver ever call back?</line>

<line>He's here.</line>

<line>Let's do it.</line>

<line>Detective.</line>

<line>Mr. and Mrs. Gordon...</line>

<line>what are you doing here?</line>

<line>We were told Bobby stole a car.</line>

<line>Jeff, use his other name. Use Sean.</line>

<line>How serious is this?</line>

<line>Serious.</line>

<line>He violated his probation,
so he's in custody.</line>

<line>Tomorrow morning he
goes before a judge.</line>

<line>Oh, God.</line>

<line>Maybe we go back to the hotel,</line>

<line>take the boys home.</line>

<line>It might not be the best way
for the boys to meet Sean.</line>

<line>I see.</line>

<line>We'll just wait till this
whole thing blows over.</line>

<line>Mr. and Mrs. Gordon,
this isn't blowing over.</line>

<line>Sean will probably go to jail
for the next two years.</line>

<line>What if we showed up at the hearing,
would the judge show leniency?</line>

<line>You can't count on that.</line>

<line>For what it's worth, I know it'd be
good for Sean to see you tomorrow.</line>

<line>Excuse us.</line>

<line>Doctor...</line>

<line>you said your wife almost divorced you,</line>

<line>but the D.C. Superior Court says
you initiated proceedings.</line>

<line>I was the one who filed. Big deal</line>

<line>It's not that you filed, Doc,
it's when you filed.</line>

<line>September ' , a month
before Linda was m*rder*d.</line>

<line>Please.</line>

<line>And we know how bad you wanted Linda.</line>

<line>I admitted that.</line>

<line>Here's what I think, Doc.</line>

<line>You already had the wife
and kids, the experience,</line>

<line>so this time you wanted a little hottie</line>

<line>to go off with, have a romp all over Europe.</line>

<line>Yeah, Linda was your girl...</line>

<line>so sexy it was silly.</line>

<line>But when you tracked her down,
you find a baby, too.</line>

<line>Bummer.</line>

<line>And now she don't want you
anymore, she only wants the kid.</line>

<line>So you damn near take her head off.</line>

<line>Tough to look at, huh?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

'<line>Cause she was a decent girl.</line>

<line>Silver, we know you hired P.I. to find Linda.</line>

<line>You had Isiah Bagley on the case
for six months, so don't tell us</line>

<line>you never went to see her again.</line>

<line>Okay, I visited Linda.</line>

<line>On October , , that night?</line>

<line>It was somewhat like you said.</line>

<line>I went there to take Linda away,
but she didn't want to go.</line>

<line>But I took it in stride.</line>

<line>You just left.</line>

<line>I hopped a train to Washington, D.C.</line>

<line>You were travelling by train.</line>

<line>Not a car? Can you prove that?</line>

<line>I purchased a round-trip ticket
from Whshington, D.C.</line>

<line>Look it up.</line>

<line>We will.</line>

<line>Here's another bummer, Doc.</line>

<line>Linda's son can put you in her
house at the time of the m*rder.</line>

<line>He remembers you taking that train.</line>

<line>A three-year-old remembers
me taking a train.</line>

<line>That's not even worth my calling a lawyer.</line>

<line>It's enough for us to call a judge
to make you submmit DNA.</line>

<line>And the hair samples and prints we
got, that's put-you-away evidence.</line>

<line>That little boy spent nine hours
sitting in his mom's blood.</line>

<line>I wanted what I wanted.</line>

<line>She should've just come away with me.</line>

<line>Kyle.</line>

<line>You gonna invite me in?</line>

<line>Four years.</line>

<line>You look so different, Rebecca.</line>

<line>How did you...?</line>

<line>Rebecca.</line>

<line>I like that, Linda.</line>

<line>Sexy.</line>

<line>How did you find me?</line>

<line>It wasn't easy and it wasn't cheap,
but the important thing is, I'm here.</line>

<line>What do you want?</line>

<line>What do you think I want?</line>

<line>You.</line>

<line>You had your chance.</line>

<line>But I told you then it was wrong.
My kids were still in school.</line>

<line>And I told you, I wasn't giving up.</line>

<line>Now I have what I wanted.</line>

<line>Yes, and that we need to talk about.</line>

<line>What a good-looking boy.</line>

<line>Funny, he doesn't resemble you.</line>

<line>Why don't you just go back to D.C., Kyle?</line>

<line>I know what you've done.</line>

<line>I know every move you've
made for the last six months.</line>

<line>Walk out of here.</line>

<line>Relax. I'm gonna help you.</line>

<line>Sean's the man in my life now.
I don't need anyone else.</line>

<line>Linda, if you look at it,
you have two choices :</line>

<line>You can come with me
or you can go to prison.</line>

<line>Come with you? Are you high?</line>

<line>I know how to get Bobby back home.</line>

<line>Don't call him that.</line>

<line>Nobody's gonna know where
he's been, right, Bobby?</line>

<line>Don't touch him!</line>

<line>You always did like it dirty.</line>

<line>Let me put my tongue in your mouth.</line>

<line>Don't talk to me like that. / Why?</line>

<line>You know you love it.</line>

<line>You've got to be kidding.</line>

<line>What are you smiling at?</line>

<line>You.</line>

<line>You were the worst I ever had.</line>

<line>Sorry, Bobby. I gotta catch a train.</line>
