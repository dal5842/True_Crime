<xml><line>Oh, Gail.</line>

<line>Hey, Larry.</line>

<line>I was just doing my woodworking,
needed a break.</line>

<line>I'm building a bridhouse for
the tweeties on my balcony.</line>

<line>You want a peek?
- I'm in a rush.</line>

<line>Yeah, I'm going
for a walk anyway.</line>

<line>Enjoy it.</line>

<line>Hey, you wanna see one of
the coolest spots in Philly?</line>

<line>It's three blocks from
here. I discovered it.</line>

<line>I've got a lot of reading to do.
And Bruce is coming over.</line>

<line>Good night, Larry.</line>

<line>How's "The Miller's Tale"
gonna help me in life?</line>

<line>Totally unreadable.</line>

<line>So drop the class.</line>

f<line>I'm going to
med school anyway.</line>

<line>Hey.</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>I'm done studying.
- I'm not.</line>

<line>Yeah, you are.</line>

<line>Bruce, I have
a seminar in the morning.</line>

<line>It's only Summer school.</line>

<line>Skip it.</line>

<line>What am I gonna have to
do, kick you out of here?</line>

<line>I'm getting sick of that story, too.</line>

<line>Came in this morning
addressed to Homicide.</line>

<line>I think it's one of yours.</line>

"<line>Number one. Kitchen floor.</line>

<line>She had a useless
cat who did nothing."</line>

"<line>Number two. Brunette.
At least two useless cats."</line>

<line>Ellen Curtis had two cats.</line>

"<line>Three. This one died on me.
And her useless cat just watched."</line>

<line>Oh... this bastard.</line>

"<line>I don't like what I do,
but I can't go yet.</line>

<line>The days are still warm."</line>

<line>That's him.</line>

<line>Try to get prints off this?</line>

<line>This guy doesn't leave prints.</line>

<line>Where has he
been for five years?</line>

<line>And why is he
sending us this letter?</line>

<line>He's bragging. He's
telling us he's back.</line>

<line>And that he's gonna do it again.</line>

<line>Guy broke in
through the window,</line>

r*ped her like all the others,
<line>but Gail he k*lled.</line>

<line>He got through those bars?</line>

<line>Guy was some kind of spider.</line>

<line>He could climb walls,
get in tiny windows.</line>

<line>So he's skinny.
- He's a contortionist.</line>

<line>Boss...</line>

<line>I don't have the constitution
to go after him again.</line>

<line>Why'd he k*ll Gail
and not the others?</line>

<line>She fought back.</line>

<line>Any physical evidence?</line>

<line>Just the DNA from his sperm,
but we never found a match.</line>

<line>I got samples from everybody--</line>

<line>the neighbors, plumbers,
handymen... nothing.</line>

<line>It was like chasing a ghost.</line>

<line>Boss, I can't do this.</line>

<line>I'm not asking you to, Nick.</line>

<line>This case became
a health issue for me.</line>

<line>Didn't you get any
direction where to look?</line>

<line>He only struck when
the weather was warm, so</line>

<line>I check out baseball teams, exchange
students coming in for the Summer...</line>

<line>Circus. / Yeah?</line>

<line>Yeah, yeah,
I interviewed a damn clown.</line>

<line>Who was the top suspect?</line>

<line>Bruce Elridge.</line>

<line>Gail's boyfriend.
- How come?</line>

<line>He gave a shady,
hostile interview.</line>

<line>Refused to give his DNA,</line>

<line>had not one good alibi
for any of the r*pes.</line>

<line>Unfortunately, Vera's under
orders not to talk to him.</line>

<line>That's not official.
- The D.A.'s office was very clear, Nick.</line>

<line>Do not approach him again.</line>

<line>What did you do to him?</line>

<line>I was on the case.</line>

<line>He was a serious suspect.</line>

<line>He put him in
the room four times.</line>

<line>What am I supposed to do,
start all over again?</line>

<line>I'll start it over.
- Whoa, this is my job.</line>

<line>I'm not gonna get cut out of it.</line>

<line>Well, which one is it,
Vera? You in or out?</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>All right. Lil will read
the case again.</line>

<line>You wanna join her, okay.</line>

<line>But I don't want you going
to Bruce without new direction.</line>

<line>We got the letter.</line>

<line>Connect him to the letter,
Nick, you can go back.</line>

<line>Not before.</line>

<line>You got an angle,
how to do that?</line>

<line>Yeah, I got an angle.</line>

<line>No. Not you again.</line>

<line>Got some questions, Larry.
- Forget it.</line>

<line>You browbeat this guy, too?</line>

<line>He's a material witness.
I talk to him sometimes.</line>

<line>Larry, it's Lily Rush.
With Homicide.</line>

<line>I need to talk to you about Gail.</line>

<line>I'll talk to you. Not him.</line>

<line>Grow up.</line>

<line>Open the door, Larry.</line>

<line>Detective Vera
will take a little walk.</line>

<line>This guy's sick, huh?</line>

<line>Anything about it say
Bruce Elridge to you?</line>

<line>The smugness fits.</line>

<line>He was such a snob.
He'd never even say hello.</line>

<line>So you didn't know him well.</line>

<line>Nah.</line>

<line>You told that you thought</line>

<line>Gail and her boyfriend were
having a fight next door.</line>

<line>If I may speak.</line>

<line>I never saw anyone else
go inside that apartment.</line>

<line>What was your
relationship with Gail?</line>

<line>Good neighbors.</line>

<line>Good friends.</line>

<line>Maybe something could have blossomed
if the world was laid out differently.</line>

<line>So now you're flirting?
You didn't say that five years ago.</line>

<line>You asked about the call,
not my relationship with Gail.</line>

<line>Did the noise from next
door wake you, Larry?</line>

<line>I was up, working.</line>

<line>Gail?</line>

<line>What's going on in there?</line>

<line>It sounds like
more than reading.</line>

.

<line>I'm at Sansom.</line>

<line>I'm worried about my neighbor.</line>

<line>That was heroic,
making that call, Larry.</line>

<line>It was instinct.</line>

<line>Anyway, uh...</line>

<line>the cops came,</line>

<line>knocked, left.</line>

<line>She was found
dead the next day.</line>

<line>Cops can't break down a door just
because some guy sense something.</line>

<line>I gave a DNA sample right off.
I'll give another one if you like.</line>

<line>That's not necessary.</line>

<line>So back to Bruce.</line>

<line>You seen him lately?</line>

<line>I did run into him a couple of months
ago, up on the Penn campus.</line>

<line>He does experiments
at med school.</line>

<line>Yeah, he was full of hot air</line>

<line>about some kind of sleep
study he's doing on cats.</line>

<line>Thank you.
- Oh, yeah.</line>

<line>Some maybe we
should check that out.</line>

<line>How'd you find out
about his research?</line>

<line>I track this guy.</line>

<line>I knew it was animals, but
I always figured it was lab rats.</line>

<line>That's him.</line>

<line>You can't talk to me.</line>

<line>That letter you
wrote gave me cause.</line>

<line>Your pal here made my life
miserable five years ago.</line>

<line>You could have ended it at
anytime by giving a DNA sample.</line>

<line>Let's not have that
conversation again.</line>

<line>Bruce,</line>

<line>I'm the one who
wanted to talk to you.</line>

<line>And who are you?</line>

<line>Detective Rush. I'm looking
back into Gail's m*rder.</line>

<line>I was wondering about the
animal research you do.</line>

<line>What about it?</line>

<line>We're talking cats, right?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>And I don't feel guilty about it
if that's your next question.</line>

<line>You k*ll those cats? / If need be.
If a person's got cancer</line>

<line>I'm not gonna worry about testing
on some useless animal.</line>

<line>Why are they useless?</line>

<line>They're sub-human.</line>

<line>Small brains.
- Like women.</line>

<line>Women have a use.</line>

<line>Bruce, why not make this easy?</line>

<line>Volunteer your DNA.</line>

<line>Fourth amendment says
I got a right to privacy.</line>

<line>Don't you wanna be
ruled out as a suspect?</line>

<line>On the contrary.</line>

<line>I don't want desperate detectives
to act like it's a discovery</line>

<line>if they match my DNA to semen
that was on Gail's sheets.</line>

<line>I was her boyfriend.</line>

<line>We were very active,</line>

<line>if you get me.</line>

<line>I'm sure my DNA's
all over that place.</line>

<line>I see.</line>

<line>I don't need a witch hunt</line>

<line>just 'cause you couldn't
solve this thing.</line>

<line>Vera.</line>

<line>What is it about this job?</line>

<line>You yap on all the time about the
other cases. Why not this one?</line>

<line>This one did things to me.</line>

<line>Like what?</line>

<line>You ever work a job
makes you feel helpless?</line>

<line>Yeah, I can always find
motive, direction, but...</line>

<line>that piece of crap, he stops.</line>

<line>Leaves me with nothing.</line>

<line>I start second guessing
everything, you know?</line>

<line>Maybe I'm not the
bad a*s I think I am.</line>

<line>I want this guy.
- So do I.</line>

<line>We can get him.</line>

<line>But I need you, Vera.</line>

<line>You know him
better than anyone.</line>

<line>If he's following his M.O.,</line>

<line>he's already hunting...</line>

<line>stalking someone right
now following her home.</line>

<line>Let's hope she's got
her windows locked.</line>

<line>I should have noticed
that they all had cats.</line>

<line>It didn't mean anything
till we got the letter.</line>

<line>It's a list of parolees who were locked up
the last five years and just got out.</line>

<line>One guy fits the time line,
but he weights pounds.</line>

<line>Since when?</line>

<line>His whole life. It ain't him.</line>

<line>Was worth a try. / Yeah.</line>

<line>Well, how'd you do today?</line>

<line>Found out Bruce Elridge
tortures cats for a living.</line>

<line>Does he?</line>

<line>Talks about useless animals
and won't give up his DNA.</line>

<line>I gotta go sit on him.</line>

<line>Make sure he doesn't climb
through anybody's window tonight.</line>

<line>I got new addresses
on the first two victims.</line>

<line>They've both moved.</line>

<line>Let's go.</line>

<line>Wait till tomorrow.</line>

<line>I don't want you going to these girls
at midnight asking about their r*pe.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Tomorrow.</line>

<line>Good night.</line>

<line>My dad told me why you're here.</line>

<line>Can I come in?</line>

<line>No, I'd rather... I'd rather talk out here.</line>

<line>We think he's back, Ellen.</line>

<line>Oh, no.</line>

<line>Can I show you a picture?</line>

<line>A detective showed me
that five years ago.</line>

<line>I know.</line>

<line>Just look again.</line>

<line>Could this be the guy
who att*cked you?</line>

<line>I couldn't say.</line>

<line>I never saw him.</line>

<line>Did his voice sound like
anyone you know?</line>

<line>I told the first detective no.</line>

<line>I don't think so.</line>

<line>You said at the time you were
certain it was a stranger.</line>

<line>Right.</line>

<line>You got a different feeling
about that now?</line>

<line>It's okay if you do.</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>No, I don't know him.</line>

<line>I really can't... I really
can't tell you anything.</line>

<line>The lead detective on
this case is female, Ellen.</line>

<line>Would you be more
comfortable talking to her?</line>

<line>Maybe.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>I gotta go to work, but, um...</line>

<line>I'm home every day by : .</line>

<line>All right.</line>

<line>Could be him.</line>

<line>Could be Yo Yo Ma.</line>

<line>I didn't see crap.</line>

<line>He covered your eyes right away.</line>

<line>I'm in my kitchen...</line>

<line>all of a sudden there's
a towel over my face.</line>

<line>Guy whispers that he's real
sorry... r*pes me right there...</line>

<line>and then stays for an hour,
talking to me.</line>

<line>I'm always nervous on first dates.</line>

<line>But we did okay, didn't we?</line>

<line>You were playing such
a sad song before.</line>

<line>You wanna play it for me?</line>

<line>I don't think so.</line>

<line>That's okay.</line>

<line>Those bars on your windows
are no good, honey.</line>

<line>They're too far apart.</line>

<line>You gotta be more careful.</line>

<line>You know what he said to
me right before he left?</line>

"<line>Wish that we had met under
different circumstances."</line>

<line>I'm sorry, Niki.</line>

<line>I just hope you finally get the guy.</line>

<line>I don't wanna make you
uncomportable, but, um...</line>

<line>you were obviously in
close contact with him.</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>He touched you. You
must have touched him.</line>

<line>Was there anything that you
felt that was distinctive?</line>

<line>Scars? Moles?</line>

<line>This is kind of weird...</line>

<line>That's okay.</line>

<line>I did touch him. I didn't
do it to be intimate...</line>

<line>Of course not.</line>

<line>I was trying to get him off me.</line>

<line>And you noticed something.</line>

<line>Smooth skin.</line>

<line>Legs, arms, everything.</line>

<line>Soft and smooth like a woman's.</line>

<line>Excuse me a second, Niki.</line>

<line>What's that?</line>

<line>Bruce Elridge's coffee cup.</line>

<line>You stole his coffee?</line>

<line>He abandoned it in a public place.</line>

<line>Now we got his precious DNA.</line>

<line>According to Niki Lamas,</line>

<line>we're looking at a guy
with super smooth skin.</line>

<line>That's new.</line>

<line>Maybe he shaves his
body before he att*cks.</line>

<line>No hair ever found at the scenes.</line>

<line>Anything from Ellen Curtis?</line>

<line>Jeffries got the sense she knew
something. I'll go back to her today.</line>

<line>And how's our boy Vera doing?</line>

<line>He's... passionate.</line>

<line>That passion almost compromised
this case five years ago.</line>

<line>I'm watching, boss.</line>

<line>I hate to rat a guy out,</line>

<line>but Vera just walked in with Bruce Elridge.</line>

<line>I can't have this...
- Let me go.¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</line>

<line>You'll want to look at this first.</line>

<line>This isn't gonna help.</line>

<line>You can't keep me here.</line>

<line>I can keep you here for six hours.</line>

<line>So what's with the animal experiments?</line>

<line>What are you, an activist?</line>

<line>Lot of K*llers start off torturing animals.</line>

<line>But smart guy like you...
know something about that.</line>

<line>So what?</line>

<line>Is that you, Bruce, hmm?</line>

<line>Did you go from cats to
women with your viciousness?</line>

<line>That's a leap.</line>

<line>You slip into their apartments with
that wimp-boy frame of yours.</line>

<line>You terrorize them and you
pretend you're on a date?</line>

<line>I've got a girlfriend.
We're very, very happy.</line>

<line>Maybe you didn't mean to k*ll Gail.</line>

<line>Just r*pe her like the others.</line>

<line>I didn't do anything to her, so why
don't you stop acting like a thug.</line>

<line>What'd you just call me, you little rube?</line>

<line>Say it again, come on!</line>

<line>Say it again.</line>

<line>Say it again!</line>

<line>Vera...</line>

<line>Looks like Bruce here
thinks I'm wasting his time.</line>

<line>Come out here.</line>

<line>Bruce has better
things to do... / Vera!</line>

<line>We got the DNA back.</line>

<line>It's a negative match.</line>

<line>You bunch of thugs!</line>

<line>Bruce... what the hell's wrong with you?</line>

<line>What's that supposed to mean?</line>

<line>You knew we wouldn't
match your DNA. / So?</line>

<line>So why not give a sample five
years ago like a normal person?</line>

<line>I got a right to privacy.</line>

<line>How's giving a swab of
spit invading your privacy?</line>

<line>A guy's got a right to have
sex with his own girlfriend.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>You weren't having sex with her.</line>

<line>Excuse me?</line>

<line>You didn't want us to not find your DNA.</line>

<line>It wasn't anywhere in that apartment,</line>

'<line>cause she was shutting you down.</line>

<line>We went out for seven months.</line>

<line>And by that time a guy's got a right.</line>

<line>You think I wanted all those
macho cops, all my friends,</line>

<line>knowing I was putting up with such a prude?</line>

<line>Hey, Bruce... this ain't high school.</line>

<line>This case died five years ago and
you could have helped us bring it in.</line>

<line>And you coming off to your
pals like some big stud</line>

<line>isn't more important than a girl dying.</line>

<line>My partner got the sense you knew
we were on the wrong trail.</line>

<line>How would I know that?</line>

<line>Maybe you saw the guy.</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Maybe... you knew the guy?</line>

<line>I really try not to think about this.
- That's understandable.¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</line>

<line>But he contacted us.</line>

<line>Let us know he's gonna do it again.</line>

<line>I can't worry about that.</line>

<line>If you could describe
him...</line>

<line>I can't. / I know that's what you've
been saying all these years,</line>

<line>but maybe it's because it's too painful.</line>

<line>Ellen, I'm just scared
it's gonna happen again.</line>

<line>I never used to be scared of anything.</line>

<line>No?</line>

<line>Now I live with my parents.</line>

<line>I'm terrified if I'm not home before dark.</line>

<line>You had a life before.</line>

<line>You just want it back.</line>

<line>I don't think that's in the cards.</line>

<line>I do.</line>

<line>But you have to start by telling
me what you saw that night.</line>

<line>It might not be relevant.</line>

<line>I was at the Free Library,
outside buying a coffee</line>

<line>and this, um... this guy started
talking to me about books</line>

<line>and I can't even remember what else.</line>

<line>But it was only for, like, a few minutes...</line>

<line>and then I went home.</line>

<line>And that was it.</line>

<line>Did you get his name?</line>

<line>Then the r*pe happened that night...</line>

<line>Olive?</line>

<line>Edie?</line>

<line>Hey, kitty, kitty, kitty.</line>

<line>You scared me.</line>

<line>I'm so sorry.</line>

<line>First dates are hard.</line>

<line>Especially with serious girls like you.</line>

<line>I just wish we could met under
different circumstances.</line>

<line>It was so quick.</line>

<line>It was like a flashbulb.</line>

<line>And I, uh... I could be wrong, but...</line>

<line>the face I keep seeing
is the guy from the library.</line>

<line>Um... dark hair...</line>

<line>kind of shaggy.</line>

<line>Smooth skin.</line>

<line>This is gonna help us a lot.</line>

<line>I'm sorry I didn't do it earlier.</line>

<line>You weren't ready earlier.</line>

<line>I should have told that first detective.</line>

<line>I was worried he'd think that
since I'd talked to the guy...</line>

<line>I'd let him on.</line>

<line>You know?</line>

<line>Detective Vera only looks
like a Neanderthal.</line>

<line>Excuse me.</line>

<line>What?</line>

<line>Sex Crimes got an as*ault,
th and Lombard.</line>

<line>Same M.O.?</line>

<line>Crawled through the
second floor window.</line>

<line>Our boy is back.</line>

(*) <line>up the drain pipe,</line>

<line>climbed cross the walls,</line>

<line>slipped in through the bars.</line>

<line>Now, that's determination.</line>

<line>Are there prints on the bars?</line>

<line>Of course not.</line>

<line>Ah, but he did leave a token behind.</line>

<line>Kenfield, filter.</line>

<line>Left it right at the bedside.</line>

<line>This the victim?</line>

<line>Yeah. Sex Crimes took her to the hopital.</line>

<line>They know you want talk to her, though.</line>

<line>We doing this together?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Please.</line>

<line>Maybe I should have
fought or something.</line>

<line>There's no "should", Tanya.</line>

<line>Does, uh... this look like him?</line>

<line>He covered my eyes so quickly.</line>

<line>Did he speak to you?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Afterwards, he talked a lot.
He talked about art and books.</line>

<line>I'm in grad school for
art history, but I don't...</line>

<line>I don't know how he knew that.</line>

<line>Did you recognize his voice? / No.</line>

<line>He was a stranger.</line>

<line>You study art history?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Been to any museums lately?</line>



<line>Um... I was at the Rodin a few days ago.</line>

<line>Did you notice anything about this skin?</line>

<line>It was... smooth.
You know, like... hairless.</line>

<line>No hair at all?</line>

<line>Didn't seem like it.</line>

<line>Do you know what he
told me before he left?</line>

<line>That he wished that we had met under...</line>

<line>Under different circumstances.</line>

<line>And that he was sorry.</line>

<line>Does this guy stalk girls
on Ben Franklin Parkway?</line>

<line>Gail worked at the Museum of Art.</line>

<line>Ellen was at the Free Library
the day she was att*cked.</line>

<line>And Tanya went to the Rodin last week.</line>

<line>Niki was on Locust.</line>

<line>Leaving the Academy of Music.</line>

<line>Maybe he targets smart girls.</line>

<line>All the victims were college types.</line>

"<line>Serious girls." He said it to Ellen.</line>

<line>Let's post this composite
all over the Parkway.</line>

<line>I got it.</line>

<line>I interviewed a woman that worked
with Gail at the art museum.</line>

<line>Anna...</line>

<line>Anna... Berlin.</line>

<line>They had lunch together
the day of the m*rder.</line>

<line>We have this now.</line>

<line>Let's see if she knows our new friends.</line>

<line>Is this who k*lled Gail?</line>

<line>Could be.</line>

<line>Do you recognize him at all?</line>

<line>I don't think so.</line>

<line>Take your time.</line>

<line>I can't be sure, but...</line>

<line>But what?</line>

<line>It sort of looks like a guy we'd
see out here at lunchtime.</line>

<line>You and Gail saw him?</line>

<line>He'd hang out here,
smoking, watching people.</line>

<line>I kind of forgot about him.</line>

<line>He hasn't been around for years,</line>

<line>but he's been back lately.</line>

<line>Ever get a name? / No.</line>

<line>We only talked to him once.</line>

<line>How's the pre-med student?</line>

<line>Arrogant. Pushy.</line>

<line>In other words, the same.</line>

<line>I know, I have bad taste in men.</line>

<line>You ladies work here?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>How's the new exhibit?</line>

<line>The Monet? It's beautiful.
I recommend it.</line>

<line>Maybe I'll take a look.</line>

<line>See you in there.</line>

<line>I didn't think to mention
it to you back then.</line>

<line>People are always aksing questions.</line>

<line>Do you think he may have
been watching Gail?</line>

<line>He wasn't there for the art.</line>

<line>Got something.</line>

<line>Girl was with a friend and her
mom on Ben Franklin Parkway.</line>

<line>Saw your composite.</line>

<line>This is Lily. She's a police officer, too.</line>

<line>Tell her what you told me.</line>

<line>That's Carl.</line>

<line>My mommy's boyfriend.</line>

<line>What do you got?</line>

<line>Carl Heeley, grew up in a trailer park
in Trenton, moved up Philly at ,</line>

worked as a security guard in the
<line>Franklin Institute from ' to ' .</line>

<line>Across from the Free Library. / Yeah.</line>

<line>And the last five years, he was
at an army base in Portland.</line>

<line>Just got back to town.</line>

<line>How'd he behave in Oregon?</line>

<line>Dishonorably discharged six weeks ago.</line>

<line>Breaking into a female officer's room.</line>

<line>Through the window.</line>

<line>She was trained in combat
though, unlike our girls.</line>

<line>She fought him, ID'd him,
and they sent him packing.</line>

<line>Military will have boold types.</line>

<line>We're getting a subpoena right now.</line>

<line>Pick up this soldier.</line>

<line>What's this about?</line>

<line>A woman was r*ped inOld City last night.</line>

<line>I'm sorry to hear that.</line>

<line>Where were you last night, Carl?</line>

<line>At home. Reading.</line>

<line>Can anyone verify that?</line>

<line>My girlfriend and her daughter.</line>

<line>You a big reader, Carl?</line>

<line>You could say.</line>

<line>You lived in the area five years
ago when three women r*ped.</line>

<line>Do you remember anything about that?</line>

<line>Not really.</line>

<line>But you heard about it, right?</line>

<line>Yeah, I think I remember something
about it, but that was a long time ago.</line>

<line>This looks a lot like you,
don't you think?</line>

<line>Sort of.</line>

<line>Can you arrest a man for
looking like a drawing?</line>

<line>We're asking guys who look like
this picture to take a DNA test.</line>

<line>Would you do that?</line>

<line>I'm sorry. I prefer not to.</line>

<line>Look, I'd love to help you out, but
I gotta get back new job and all.</line>

<line>So, is there anything else?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Crap.</line>

<line>It was a Kenfield filter.</line>

<line>Carl and I used to date, so...</line>

<line>Well, you lived together, that's a
bit different than dating, isn't it?</line>

<line>Cait, honey, take Dolly
and play in the room, okay?</line>

<line>We lived together five years ago.
We broke up when he moved.</line>

<line>If you broke up, how'd
you get this Army picture?</line>

<line>We kept in touch.</line>

<line>Caitlin says that Carl's
still your boyfriend.</line>

<line>That he's been around
the apartment a lot.</line>

<line>Yeah, well... maybe
I never got over him.</line>

<line>Do you remember those
r*pes five years ago?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Do you remember that
a girl was m*rder*d?</line>

<line>What, you trying to say that was Carl?</line>

<line>This is the guy.</line>

<line>You tell me, Bridget.</line>

<line>Carl is a good person.</line>

<line>He is.</line>

<line>He is. Just should see him
with Caitlin and animals.</line>

<line>Down at that shelter you work at?</line>

<line>Yeah. He helps out sometimes.</line>

<line>You got any pets here?</line>

<line>No, no.</line>

<line>Carl always says that dogs are for
families and cats are for single girls.</line>

<line>Mm. Carl says that, huh?
- Yeah, we joke about it.</line>

<line>You know, cats and book clubs,</line>

<line>two sure signs that a woman's
all alone in the world.</line>

<line>I'm guessing you wouldn't be
caught dead at a book club.</line>

<line>I noticed your Shakespeare
collection over there.</line>

<line>Yeah, Carl got that at a garage sale.</line>

<line>You guys read the tragedies together?</line>

<line>He looks at'em sometimes.
I don't like books.</line>

<line>Maybe that's why he
took off five years ago.</line>

<line>What do you mean?</line>

<line>Nothing.</line>

<line>No, what?</line>

<line>We talked to Carl earlier today
and he just wasn't, uh...</line>

<line>very complimentary about
your... brain power.</line>

<line>That's mean.</line>

<line>I thought so.</line>

<line>Was he with you last night?</line>

<line>Yeah, he was here.</line>

<line>He go out after?</line>

<line>He went out for a walk, late.</line>

'<line>Cause there was another
r*pe last night.</line>

<line>Another woman who
lives alone, with a cat.</line>

<line>Carl take a lot of walks?</line>

<line>Yeah. He has trouble sleeping.</line>

<line>He always did.</line>

<line>Honey... what's wrong?</line>

<line>Nothing. Can't sleep is all.</line>

<line>Come back to bed.</line>

<line>I'm gonna get some air.</line>

<line>Okay.</line>

<line>Be careful.</line>

<line>You, too.</line>

<line>Keep the windows closed.</line>

<line>Yeah, he did that a lot.</line>

<line>He'd leave in the middle of the night.</line>

<line>Didn't you think it was pretty odd
that he shaved like that Bridget?</line>

<line>He always shaved,
you know? He said, um...</line>

<line>it had to do, you know,
with biking, for speed.</line>

<line>Did he always shave at midnight?</line>

<line>I don't know.</line>

<line>You remember the r*pes,
though, don't you?</line>

<line>Yeah.</line>

<line>Didn't you ever think...</line>

<line>That I was living with a r*pist?</line>

<line>No, I never thought that. Would you?</line>

<line>Does it make sense now?</line>

<line>Yeah, I guess.</line>

<line>With the walks and all.</line>

<line>Now that I think about it,</line>

he's only ridden that bike a couple
<line>times since I've known him.</line>

<line>Bridget?</line>

<line>I'm so sorry Carl.</line>

<line>You really should be more careful.</line>

<line>I just wish we should've met
under different circumstances.</line>

<line>Why are you here?</line>

<line>We just wanna chat. Again.</line>

<line>We called the base up in Oregon.</line>

<line>Seems you got the same
blood type as our r*pist.</line>

<line>Type A is pretty common.</line>

<line>We've got your letter, too.</line>

<line>I'm not much of a writer.</line>

<line>Plus that cigarette you left at Tanya's--</line>

<line>tells me you're just about
ready to stop this.</line>

<line>How'd them army boys deal with
you shaving your chest and your legs?</line>

<line>I cut that out up there.</line>

<line>Didn't wanna be on the wrong
side of "don't ask, don't tell," huh?</line>

<line>I just didn't get much of a
chance to bike in Oregon.</line>

<line>What kind of people do
you come from... Carl?</line>

<line>Nothing special.</line>

<line>Educated?</line>

<line>No.</line>

<line>Low rent?</line>

<line>You could say.</line>

<line>Not a lot of books in
the trailer, I take it?</line>

<line>My mom couldn't read.</line>

<line>What about that sister of yours,</line>

the one that's in jail for
<line>prostitution? She a... big scholar?</line>

<line>Yeah, you come from trash,
you end up trash.</line>

<line>With a trash girlfriend. You were
looking for someone better.</line>

<line>A classy girl with... education.</line>

<line>I like girls with culture who don't
eat their takeout right out of a box.</line>

<line>Hm, like Bridget?</line>

<line>Bridget's never been to
a museum in her life.</line>

<line>So you went looking for a girl
with a little something upstairs.</line>

<line>Trolling through the
museums and libraries</line>

<line>till you found her, then
you followed her home.</line>

<line>Looked to see if there
was a cat in her window,</line>

'<line>cause that meant she
was all alone in there.</line>

<line>And you got that talent
for getting into tiny places.</line>

<line>Talk or don't talk.</line>

<line>It doesn't matter anymore.</line>

<line>Bridget gave us your razor.</line>

<line>It's at the DNA lab right now. / Yep.</line>

<line>We're just waiting for the official word.</line>

<line>I used to slide down the laundry
chute at my best friend's building.</line>

<line>You can't believe how narrow it was.</line>

<line>I'd get into the neighbor's
house and steal things.</line>

<line>It was like the one thing that
I was really, really good at,</line>

<line>getting into small places.</line>

<line>I was, like, known for it.</line>

<line>That's sensational, Carl.</line>

<line>I told you... I was ready soon,
soon as the weather changed.</line>

<line>Yeah. You told us.</line>

<line>I just had these demons.</line>

<line>Is that why you joined the military?</line>

<line>To maybe get some discipline?</line>

<line>I kept them down for a while,
but they came back.</line>

<line>The... one in Oregon was a fighter,
like the other ont that... / Gail.</line>

<line>The girl you m*rder*d.</line>

<line>I just wanted to...</line>

<line>date her, you know, not hurt her.</line>

<line>Quiet. I am sorry.</line>

<line>Studying, huh?</line>

<line>College girl?
- Let me... go!</line>

<line>You should be more careful.</line>

<line>That window's wide open.</line>

<line>Gail. / Be quite.</line>

<line>What's going on there?</line>

<line>Be quite. Quite. Quite.</line>

<line>Sounds like more than
reading. / Quite. Quite.</line>

<line>I just wish we could've met
under different circumstances.</line>
