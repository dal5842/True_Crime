                    <p>Hi all! My name is Dannika Love and I am a DIGIT student at Penn State

                        along with a brother-in-law, Dan. I enjoy being creative, along with cooking
                        and bakeing. I also just like having time to relax on my phone. I am a
                        really big family person, I love my family so much, I currently live two
                        hours from home to go to college and it is not the easiest thing to do. I
                        enjoy hanging out with my family and my boyfriend, Gavin, along with his
                        family. I love going to see my grandma, who is an absolute hoot. </p>

                    <h2>Emily Kalie</h2>
                    <p>Hello fellow Digit lovers, my name is Emily Kalie and I am 23 years old. I
                        will be graduating this coming December. I love to spend time with my family
                        and close friends. My family has two Golden Retrievers, Murphy and Maple.
                        They are a bit crazy and sometimes a handful but bring the most love to
                        everyone who meets them. I am a huge Pittsburgh Penguins fan and love to
                        watch all of their games. I also enjoy the time I get to spend volunteering
                        at the Emmaus Soup kitchen each month with my mom. I have a strong love for
                        technology with a passion for adapting to & learning new technology. </p>
