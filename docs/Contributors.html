                    <p>Hi my name is Gabriella, I go by Gabi. I am one of the DIGIT majors here at
                        Penn State Behrend. I hail from the Pittsburgh area and began my college
                        career at Penn State New Kensington where I served as a Student Athlete
                        before transferring north.</p>
                    <p>I led the web design, architecting the HTML structure and optimizing CSS to
                        create a cohesive, visually engaging, and user‑friendly interface that
                        seamlessly showcased my teammates’ contributions.</p>

                    <h2>Dannika Love</h2>
                    <p>Hi all! My name is Dannika Love and I am a DIGIT student at Penn State
                        Behrend! I am the daughter of Jodie and Ron, I have an older sister, Kalie,
                        along with a brother-in-law, Dan. I enjoy being creative, along with cooking
                        and bakeing. I also just like having time to relax on my phone. I am a
                        really big family person, I love my family so much, I currently live two
                        hours from home to go to college and it is not the easiest thing to do. I
                        enjoy hanging out with my family and my boyfriend, Gavin, along with his
                        family. I love going to see my grandma, who is an absolute hoot.</p>
                    <p>As team lead, I contributed extensively to data processing, analysis, and web
                        development. I began by uploading the episode transcripts as individual text
                        files. I developed multiple web pages, including one displaying the original
                        XML, XSLT, and output files, and another featuring a breakdown of the show’s
                        main characters along with an SVG-based character connection visualization.
                        Using AntConc, I identified two sets of groups—keywords and character
                        names—and created two corresponding kumu.io visualizations. I also generated
                        an SVG frequency graph for both groups to enhance the project’s visuals.
                        Additionally, I wrote a Python script that processed XSLT-filtered dialogue
                        files to produce a TSV file, which was then used to create a Cytoscape
                        network visualization. I manually went through each processed xml file to
                        add additional attributes that were missed by the xslt that I thought would
                        add more and then made a relaxNG file and associated it with xml files. I
                        added a Creative Commons license to the project and linked all sources
                        referenced during our research. Throughout the project, I delegated tasks to
                        team members and managed pull requests to keep our GitHub repository
                        organized and up to date.</p>

                    <h2>Emily Kalie</h2>
                    <p>Hello fellow Digit lovers, my name is Emily Kalie and I am 23 years old. I
                        will be graduating this coming December. I love to spend time with my family
                        and close friends. My family has two Golden Retrievers, Murphy and Maple.
                        They are a bit crazy and sometimes a handful but bring the most love to
                        everyone who meets them. I am a huge Pittsburgh Penguins fan and love to
                        watch all of their games. I also enjoy the time I get to spend volunteering
                        at the Emmaus Soup kitchen each month with my mom. I have a strong love for
                        technology with a passion for adapting to &amp; learning new technology.</p>
                       <p> This project team worked well together. My main contributions to this
                        project was a lot of Jupyter Notebook work, that dealt with our episodes
                        text files and turning them into TSV documents or just regular data output
                        to then incorporate into our project. The TSV’s that I made mostly worked
                        but the one that I made with all of the episodes finding verbs, names, and
                        proper nouns, was able to be brought into CytoScape. But when it came time
                        to adding my Cyto to our html page I tried everything and still could not
                        get the Cyto to work in an interactive way on our page. I also made the
                        About page on the site that states different information about the show,
                        cast, and plot. I created an SVG’s that we used as a part of our
                        visualizations, this SVG was comparing the top 25 verbs throught the epiodes
                        formated in a bar chart. </p>

                    <h2>Raashee Mishra</h2>
                    <p>Hey! My name is Raashee and I am from New Jersey and am a 20 year old college
                        student. I am currently in my third year of studying in the DIGIT program at
                        the Pennsylvania State University. I have a passion for publication design,
                        web developing, and graphic design. Alongside, I enjoy following fashion and 
                        reading any and all science fiction!</p>
                    <p>My contributions to this project range over several responsibilities. In order 
                       to transform the raw text files of the "Cold Case" transcripts to clean, source 
                       text files our team could work with, I developed an XSLT that applied XML markup 
                       to all 23 text files. Integrated within this XSLT was Regex, this facilitated 
                       the markup process to tackle the several inconsistencies within the transcripts, 
                       to lay a solid foundation for the next phase of our project, text analysis! After 
                       establishing our research goals for our text analysis, more XSLTs were developed 
                       (with the help of Dr.B) to assist us with this process. Using the outputs of an 
                       XSLT that created text files consisting of any music within the episodes, I based 
                       my text analysis on finding patterns of theme within the word frequency of the 
                       music lyrics within these text files in hopes they correlate to the theme of it's 
                       respective episode. To do this, I used Jupyter Notebook to create an SVG of a bar 
                       graph that displayed the most frequently used verbs in all of the music text files. 
                       Then, to develop a means of text analysis with more intricacy, I used Jupyter 
                       Notebook to produce TSV files to input within Cytoscape. This outputted a network 
                       that displays the most frequently mentioned verbs within each episode. In order to 
                       display these developments, I created a soundtrack page on our website that provides 
                       context for users to understand my research goals. Additionally, I worked with Emily 
                       to make our Cytoscape page fully interactive with additional descriptive elements. 
                       To do this, I used Jupyter Notebook to output Java Script files to embed within the 
                       HTML file for this Cytoscape webpage.</p>
