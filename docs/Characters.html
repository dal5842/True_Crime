            <h2>Lily Rush</h2>

            <img src="Images/Lilly_Rush.JPG" alt="Lily Rush" />
        </figure>
        <p>Lillian “Lilly” Rush is the main character of Cold Case, portrayed by Kathryn Morris. She
            is Philadelphia’s first female homicide detective specializing in solving cold cases
            alongside her partner, Scotty Valens. Lilly is deeply dedicated to justice, believing
            that all victims deserve to be remembered.</p>
        <p>Raised in poverty by an alcoholic mother, Lilly had a traumatic childhood. Her father
            abandoned the family, and she suffered a violent attack as a child. These experiences
            left her with significant trust issues, affecting her relationships, particularly with
            men. Her relationship with her sister, Christina, is strained due to past betrayals, and
            she has a complicated dynamic with her absentee father, whom she reconnects with later
            in life.</p>
        <p>At work, Lilly is highly skilled, known for her interrogations and relentless pursuit of
            justice. She has a close, almost familial bond with her boss, John Stillman, and a deep
            trust in Scotty Valens, despite past conflicts. Throughout the series, she survives
            multiple life-threatening incidents, including being shot and nearly drowning.</p>
        <p>Despite facing personal and professional challenges, Lilly remains committed to her work.
            By the end of the series, she is offered a job with the FBI, leaving her future
            uncertain.</p>

        <h2>Scotty Valens</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="Images/Scotty_Valens.JPG" alt="Scotty Valens" />
        </figure>
        <p>Scotty Valens is a Philadelphia homicide detective who joined in 2003 as Lilly Rush’s
            partner. Initially cocky, he quickly earned his squad’s respect despite a turbulent
            personal life. Born in the 1970s to Cuban immigrants, he idolized his older brother,
            Mike, and secretly witnessed his abuse by a boxing coach. His career began in undercover
            work, where he developed feelings for Ana Castilla, a woman trapped in the drug trade,
            but she was murdered.</p>
        <p>Scotty’s relationships were complicated. He stayed with his schizophrenic childhood
            sweetheart, Elisa, out of guilt, but after her suicide, he was haunted by the belief she
            was murdered. He later dated Christina Rush, ADA Alexandra Thomas, and lab technician
            Frankie Rafferty, but all relationships ended due to betrayal, guilt, or professional
            conflicts. His rebellious streak often put him at odds with authority, notably when he
            saved Lilly from a hostage situation, leading to a suspension. He later confronted his
            past, helping his brother testify against their childhood abuser and seeking justice for
            his mother after she was assaulted. Despite personal struggles, Scotty remained a
            passionate and dedicated detective, driven by loyalty and a deep sense of justice.</p>

            <img src="Images/Kat_Miller.JPG" alt="Kat Miller" />
        </figure>
        <p>Kat Miller joined the Philadelphia Homicide Squad in 2005 after working undercover in
            Narcotics. She has a daughter, Veronica, from a past encounter with gang member Jarrod
            Jones. A haunting case from 2002, where a teen died in her arms, was solved years later.
            She was once shot in the line of duty and later transferred to Homicide after impressing
            Lieutenant Stillman. In 2009, she briefly dated ADA Curtis Bell, but their relationship
            ended when she resisted Jarrod’s bid for joint custody. By 2010, she allowed Jarrod
            visitation, and her relationship with Curtis hinted at a possible reconciliation.</p>

        <h2>Nick Vera</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="Images/Nick_Vera.JPG" alt="Nick Vera" />
        </figure>
        <p>Detective Nick Vera is a tough but skilled investigator in the Philadelphia Homicide
            unit. Born in the late 1960s, he learned some Russian from his grandfather and played
            hockey in high school. He joined the police force in 1989 and helped a Russian family
            seeking asylum, later attending the funeral of one of them after her murder. By 1998, he
            had become a detective, working a series of rape cases, including the murder of Gail
            Chimayo. His aggressive pursuit of a suspect led to frustration when the case remained
            unsolved, leaving a lasting impact on him.</p>

        <h2>John Stillman</h2>

            <img src="Images/John_Stillman.JPG" alt="John Stillman" />
        </figure>
        <p>Lieutenant John Stillman leads the Philadelphia cold case squad with a stern but caring
            approach. A Vietnam veteran, he carries war-era stress and personal struggles, including
            his daughter Janie’s assault and his failed marriage, strained by his dedication to the
            job. He once had an affair with Diane Yates and has a brother who is a Catholic priest.
            After taking an unpaid leave to protect a colleague, he briefly retired but later
            returned to duty. In season 7, he clashed with Patrick Doherty, who resented him for
            imprisoning his son and exposing corruption.</p>

        <h2>Will Jeffries</h2>

            <img src="Images/Will_Jeffries.JPG" alt="Will Jeffries">
        </figure>
        <p>Detective Will Jeffries was the most senior member of Philadelphia’s Homicide unit, known
            for his dedication to justice, particularly in cases affecting the Black community.
            Raised in a troubled home, he was mentored by a store owner who set him on the right
            path. A former football player, his career ended due to injury, and he later served in
            Vietnam. Jeffries lost his wife, Mary, in a hit-and-run in 1995, an event that shaped
            his commitment to road safety and justice. His deep sense of duty sometimes led to
            conflicts, including punching an ADA over a wrongful conviction. Though respected and
            serious about his work, he remained shy in his personal life, unwilling to move on from
            his late wife despite encouragement from colleagues.</p>

        </figure>
        <p>Chris Lassing, nicknamed “Lass” by Lilly Rush, was her partner until 2003. While a
            competent and hardworking detective, he didn’t share her passion for cold cases. A
            smoker, Lassing struggled with the long hours of the job and later transferred out of
            the Homicide unit due to diabetes. He was replaced by Scotty Valens.</p>
