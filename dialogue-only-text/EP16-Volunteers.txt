Get her in the back.What... what do I...?
- Follow directions.Okay, let me get out first.The guys were digging up the
foundation of the old Calvin building.They made the discovery this morning.Two bags of bones.In the cement?
- No, underneath.So they got thrown in here when they
were first putting up the building?Yeah, the doer figured
they were buried forever,and now the city wants a parking lot.The remains are mostly skeletal,but they were buried in plastic, so,
uh, a lot of the clothes survived.One male... one female.How can you tell that?Pelvic bones. Shoe size.When did bell bottoms
come back in style,five years ago?Don't look at me.They've been down here
more than five years.This building's at least years old.So they're from the original
days of bell bottoms.The ' 's.Those pants were ugly
the first time around.Look at that.Summer of love.Where did it all go wrong?. You weren't even
born yet, right?World had to wait till the ' s for me.You know how many words
there are for narcissist?Scotty.Hey. You okay?Yeah. You just forgot to fill
this out before you left.I'll see you upstairs.Hi... uh, I'm Elisa.Lilly. / Hi.My partner.You're a detective?Yeah.You're so beautiful.Thanks.See you up there.Sorry.Did I embarrass you? / No.You never told me
your partner was a girl.Yeah.We... okay today?Yeah.It's a good day, I think.Quiet.No box on these two jobs.Had to go to Missing Persons.A white woman and black man
disappeared together June , .Missing persons didn't
knock themselves out.If you're over and of sound mind,
you're allowed to disappeared.And the lifesyle.A lot of people disappeared
in the ' s.Some of 'em don't even know it.The woman was Julia Hoffman, ,reported missing by her
parents, now deceased.Lived in a commune.Disappeared with Gerard Gary, .Looks like Julia's station
wagon disappeared, too.We ran an NCIC search,see if the car ever turned
up anywhere, but no luck.These bodies were dumped professional
style in that construction site.Which says organized crime.So how does that intersect
with hippies?dr*gs?Had to buy them somewhere.Maybe the black-white
thing bothered somebody.You got any family contacts
on either of them?No, but we have a name
on a boyfriend for Julia.Another commune member.You mean the guy she was
found with wasn't her boyfriend?If he was, she had one at home, too.Not a bad motive for
boyfriend Number One,there being a Number two.Let's go see this commune guy.Adam Clarke, where are you now?Life coach.You get to choose...how to view your experience.What's the empowering choice?Taking responsibility.Winners take responsibility, all right?All right. See everyone tomorrow.Thanks.Adam Clarke?Yeah.Detective Rush and Valens, Homicide.That's a room-emptier.We're here about Julia Hoffman.You were dating her in ?Yeah.Till she disappeared on me.Her remains have been found.Along with the remains of Gerard Gary.You mind?They're herbal.I thought Julia went to Canada
with that Gerard guy.Looks like they never
made it out of the city.Ugly.What kind of relationship
did you two have?Six months of hot and
heavy in the commune.Serious?No. I was more serious
about ending the w*r.So her being with this other
guy didn't rile you at all.We had an open relationship.It was the ' s.It was part of the revolution--change the world,
change ourselves.But human nature doesn't always
conform to revolutionary ideals.Well, that's why I do this work.And that's being a life coach,
I take it.It's easy to make fun of.We have a saying:Being cynical's the booby prize."Any idea if Julia and Gerard
were dealing dr*gs?No chance.Aw, come on, Adam -- summer of ' .Oh, we took dr*gs,
for sure, but... dealing?We just weren't that organized.The last time you saw Julia, did
you fight, and part on bad terms?Furthest thing from it.It's time.Our soldiers are coming
home in body bags!The Vietnamese people die and die!Now, there comes a time when you
have to throw yourself into history,not stand on the sidelines.My draft card!You let'em arrest me!I'm saying no!I'm saying hell, no!I... won't... go!Hell, no, we won't go!Hell, no, we won't go!Hell, no, we won't go!Hell, no, we won't go!Hell, no, we won't go!Hell, no, we won't go!Hell, no, we won't go!Glory days, huh?Intense...
as we used to say.And Julia and Gerard being together,that didn't bring up any intense
feelings, like jealousy?It hurt, some.But that was our deal.Who was the girl with Julia?Her friend Terri.She lived with us for awhile.Remember her last name?Maxwell.A rich Cherry Hill girl who came and
played hippie for a couple of years.Now she's a rich art dealer.Julia and I were on dishes
duty at the commune.The men were totally into equality
until we ran out of clean plates.So you knew Adam Clarke?Of course! He was the
king of the commune.Well, he claims he didn't mind
Julia being with Gerard.You believe that?I do, actually.Only because he was
so... self-absorbed.How so?He was the star of the
anti-w*r movement.And he was inspiring, I admit.But he was an a*s.He thought of himself as
a babe magnet, ' s-style.Well, even babe magnets
don't like being dumped.Especially babe magnets.I just don't think he cared
enough about Julia to harm her.Right.There is something I didn't
tell the police in ' .In my world, back then...you just didn't tell the
cops a lot of things.Oink, oink?Yeah.What didn't you tell?Julia and Gerard were into
something... clandestine.Like what?There were a lot of
secret phone calls...who called himself Dr.L.And Julia always had
these envelopes of cash.And how do you know
Gerard was involved?The night before they disappeared,they were planning something.Hell, no, we won't go!Hell, no, we won't go!The meeting place
doesn't work anymore.I know.a.m. tomorrow,
we pick up on a new corner.She'll have the bread?Yep.You scared?No way, baby. You?Hell, no, we won't go!Does he know?I'd never tell him.Julia was your best friend, and
you didn't ask her what was up?She didn't wanna tell me.And to be honest,
I was scared to know.I was a suburbs girl trying
out the commune life.If it ever got too gritty,
I knew I could always go home.But Julia, she was for real,and she was into something... deep.Forensics found a long
brown hair with the bodiesunder a piece of tape
on the plastic.Could be Julia's.We'll catch a break if it's not.Any leads on the missing car?Mm. Sludge.What about it?Uh, it was smeared on
the plastic and the clothes,and has caffeic acid
and pyrazine in it.Chemicals made in
manufacturing coffee.k*ller gave'em one last cappuccino?Or they were wrapped
up near the waterfrontby the Bogata Coffee plant.Was it there in ' ?Established ' .Smart, Nicky.Gives a specific place to
dredge for a station wagon.That enough to get the divers out?I'll call the Marine Unit.I was at Woodstock, you know.You?Jimi Hendrix. That cat could play.Did he say "cat"?You take your clothes off
and roll in the mud, boss?Uh, set-up and security
for one of the vendors.Which one?Porta Potti.Now I'm seeing it.Let's take a look.There's a real time capsule for you.years as a fish motel.What've you got there, Lil,
a dead fish?Or a wallet.I should be doing this in the lab.I won't tell on you, Louie.Want an Orange Crush?Yeah.So, Elisa you actually
introduce people to.Sets her apart.Yeah.I'm sorry about that, uh, comment.I don't mind getting
called beautiful.Well, she's not a hundred
percent healthy.Doctor calls it a...
a thinking disorder.Sometimes she...I think he's ready.This pouch was inside the wallet.And it seems to be airtight.Like a ziplock?Right.So it protected whatever's inside.Maybe.What is it?It's an address." Spruce Street. Jane."West Philly.Do not give out address
except in emergency."I'd call a double m*rder an emergency.Detectives Rush and Valens.We're looking for Jane.You're here about Jane?Yeah. Is she here?Well, Jane's not a person.Jane's an organization.I'm Dr.Linden.Dr.L.Yeah. Please come in.They were volunteers.Then they stopped, suddenly.What were they volunteers for?Jane.An ab*rtion service.Underground.In the ' s, ab*rtion was illegal.Women still had them, of course.Yeah. Coat hangers.Knitting needles.Ballpoint pens.Jane's purpose was to
keep people away fromthose dangerous procedures,and provide them with safe ones.And you were a provider?Yeah.Until ' , when the law changed.What's with the name, "Jane"?Security.Everything had to be anonymous.How'd that work?Well, women would call
a number and ask for Jane.The volunteers would call back,
set up an appointment.That what Julia and Gerard did?They escorted the patients,
handled the money,they did everything.When did you last see them?In the morning, the day
they disappeared.They brought over a young girl...Sorry about the blindfold.I wouldn't tell anything.Especially if you don't
know where we are.It's not dangerous.It's gonna be okay.What do I have to do?The doctor will talk you through it.He's a real doctor?You'll get a D and C.I don't know what that is.Dilation and curettage.It's the safest way.
Dr.L's real good.He helped me.Doctor, this is Renee.How do you do?Come with me now.We'll get through this together.The procedure went fine.Julia and Gerard left with her...and that's all I know.You never got the girl's last name?No.I had to protect my medical license.But Jane must've had her infomation,
in case something went wrong.Probably.But I only knew the contact people.Did you get a new contact
after Julia and Gerard?Colette Ferguson.She's a poly sci professor at Temple.I had an emergency number
and first name for that girl.Renee.No last name?When Julia and Gerard went missing,
I called her, like it was routine.She said everything was fine.You save that number?I did.I don't know why.Last link to Julia, probably.I'd have to find it.You were close to Julia?We met under the worst of circumstances.You okay?He says I am.Does he do it here?The kitchen.What's he use?A bicycle spoke.He says to keep it in
twenty... four hours...then it happens.He's supposed to be good.You got the $ ?I...I-I have $ .Okay, it's four.I couldn't get more.I'll get you some wine.
Calm you down.He made me touch him before.W-We should leave.She took me home, checked
in on me the next day.Which was lucky for me,
because I had an infection.By the time she got me to the hospital...Bad, huh?Couldn't have children because of it.So... how did Julia get to Dr.Linden?She found an ad for Jane
in the Free Weekly.She was so grateful after,
she went to work for Jane.I did, too.And she brought Gerard in?No, he was already a volunteer.
That's how they met.Why was he doing it? He know
someone who had one?Most everyone does, son.Sounds risky.Especially for Gerard.Why's that?He was in the Black Liberation Front.They were very militant,
and dead set against ab*rtion.Considered it genocide for Black people.Dead set as in m*rder?His working for Jane was like a
declaration of w*r to some people.Know anyone we can
talk to from the BLF?Lionel Royce was the
leader the local chapter.Where's Lionel now?I hear he's in and out of prison.Where he belongs, if he's
the one hurt those two.We want to talk to you about
your old friend Gerard Gary.Tragic man.Limitless potential, unwise choices.You didn't like some of his activities.Helping black girls commit genocide?No. I didn't like it.But I'm a peaceful man.So what's the r*fle about?Remember George W. Bush in that
flight suit, landing on the aircraft carrier?All about the image.This... armed robbery beef
you're in for, that just image?I was collecting reparations for sl*very.From a -eleven?Look, I had issues with Gerard.However, if you're
suggesting I'd k*ll a brother?We were way too busy getting
spied on, lied to, informed on,and framed-up by the U.S.
Government to turn on each other.You think you had an
informant in the BLF.I know there were informants.And maybe Gerard was one?It's possible.Way I see it, the White
man's got your mind,and the White woman's
got your Jonhson.She's a friend.No, our friends don't come in that color.What, you tellin' me who I can see?We gotta be role models, brother Gerard.Can't be running around with no
blue eye, blond hair Barbie doll.Man, you gonna turn white yourself.In case you haven't noticed,
the black don't rub off.But this is serious, brother.You know our secrets, man.You pillow talk with that girl?Huh?You can't trust no white girl.This ain't real to them.They just playing a game.This will never be real to them.We got to have to dry clean
this place of yours, Gerard.You think I'd betray you?Standard operating procedure.So the Black Liberation Front thought
Gerard was talking to the FBI.Even if he was, we'd never
use a b*llet on a black man.How'd you know it was a b*llet?Just a metaphor, brother man.Thanks for meeting me here.My kids are home... you know.Sure.These people were good to me.I feel like they saved my life.You were ?I didn't come from money,
and I wasn't smart.I wasn't gonna go to college or
anything, but I wanted to get out.Yeah.Have a life that was bigger
than two square miles.If I had a baby in high school...Who knew about you being pregnant?No one, for weeks.And then I told my boyfriend.He feel the same as you?Wow.Yeah.So we'll get married.Charlie, I was thinking an ab*rtion.That's illegal.How do you even...?I'm trying to find out.Renee...I applied Pan Am.Stewardess training.I did real good on the test.Tell them something's come up.Charlie, I want to go places...London and stuff, you know?We can go places together.No, we can't.If we have a baby... we'll
never even leave Fishtown.You talk like your mind's made up.I need money.Screw you, Renee.So you were on your own.I asked around and finally
found a girl at schoolwhose cousin had a number for "Jane".How'd you pay for it?Sold a coat and my record player.And Charlie?I thought it was best if we
didn't have any contact.But...?Renee...you said those people saved your life.I thought I saw his truck.That day?Right before they picked me up.I had no idea anything
happened to those people.I wasn't upset about it.That's not what Renee said.She said you wanted to get married.That's what you were supposed
to say if you got a girl in trouble.So you didn't want to marry her?No.Excuse me.And you were for the ab*rtion?I didn't want to get involved.Then why were you at the meeting place
the day Renee went for the procedure?She saw your truck, Charlie.Look this is years later.My wife... / No one's
talking to your wife.I followed Renee.Saw her meet those hippies.And...?I tailed the car to West Philly.Where's Renee?Be cool, man.Shut that door.
- She in here?No, no, this is a private home.
You can't just crash in here.I'm gonna call the cops.No, no you don't wanna do that.But look at you, you're just a kid.How old are you?Seventeen.You want a baby at ?And a wife before your senior prom?Look, how about some air, brother?I cried on that hippie's
shoulder for ten minutes.Then what?Nothing.Home.Where were you two
hours later that day?Home.With anyone?Yeah, my mom.
She's gone now.That's too bad, Charlie.Cause those hippies
went missing that day.Look, I didn't want Renee to do it.But in retrospect, it was
the right thing for me.Did you realize that
before or after they died?Lil, Scotty, we got
the FBI file on Jane.What, they had a file?And they gave it up?It's public record now.We get names of informants?No, they drew the line there,
but we did get these.Yeah, surveillance photos
of the Jane volunteers.Julia and Gerard, picking up
and dropping off womenApril through June of ' .This your young Renee?That's her.Then this was the day they disappeared.Someone else was there.Someone who took these photos
and gave them to the Feds.An informant.That nut case Lionel was right.Lionel thought Gerard was a snitch.Gerard didn't take these.So who did?Informants?Sound off the wall?Sounds dated.Our case is dated.There were always rumors like that.Looks like a parlor game at the commune,trying to decide who the snitch was.Weird.It was a paranoid time.Well, it seems there was
someone watching Julia.Then I guess it wasn't paranoia.So in the parlor game,
who'd you suspect?It wasn't a suspicion.Intuition?Adam and Julia were non-monogamous.He told us.And I...Had first-hand knowledge of that?Yes.Granted, I was sort of
tripping at the time.It's so fragile.Can I take its picture?These are great.I'm documenting the movement.Yeah?I'm gonna do a book someday...tell the story.I love this one of Julia.Yeah.Have any of me?I'll take some right now.How about a rich Jersey girl
beds penniless draft dodger.The camera was pretty
sophisticated for a guy like him.It came into my mind for a
second, but I was so flatteredthe movement I put it out again.He ever put out that book?Boss, we got some.Yeah, us, too.Adam Clarke, burning his draft card in ' .He told us about that.Problem is, Adam shouldn't
have had a draft card in ' .We checked his military records.
He's already served.Vietnam, ' to ' .Really?When Adam gets home,
it gets more interesting.He crossed state lines driving
a "peace van" loaded with weed.Arrested for drug sales.Thought he was too
disorganized for that.The case should have
bought him state time.But then the feds took over
jurisdiction.Poof. Case went away.He made a deal with them.Became a CI.Stay in the movement,
keep us informed."Now those photos he had
of Julia really make sense.Black and White, long lens.Adam Clarke: ' s babe magnet,
star of the anti-w*r movement.And FBI informant.That'd be big news.Big, bad news.And if Julia found out?There's your motive for m*rder.Do you mind?Not at all.I know why you're here, Lilly.Yeah?I was an informant fot the FBI in .Go on.My old case agent called.
Give me a heads up.Questions were being asked.They didn't give us name. / I know.And when you told me
about Julia and Gerard,I... I hoped that my background
was irrelevant, but...it may not be.I was surveilling them
the day they disappeared.June , :a.m.Yeah. This guy's name is
Charlie Rinzler.I-I know who he is.Is-is that all you have of him?Oh, he was so agitated,
I reported it to my case agent.The Feds ran his license,
had me follow him for a week,but nothing much came of it.So, you have photos of Charlie from the
week after Julia and Gerard went missing?Yeah, but nothing too exciting.Can I see them anyway?I basically followed him every
day for a week to and from work.He was a day worker, in construction.Can I take these?They're yours...if I can ask a favor.If we can keep your secret, we will.You worked construction back
in the s, huh, Charl?Yeah, couple of summers.Remember a job at the Calvin Building,summer of ' ?Putting down the foundation?Maybe.Cause that just happens to be
where Julia and Gerard were dumped.The same week you worked there.It's an amazing coincidence.Mm, too amazing.That-that can't be right.This is you at the
construction site, Charlie.Who the hell took that?
- Good luck you had.That foundation was being laidjust when you needed to
stash two dead hippies.I never hurt them.That guy was nice to me.Long as that building was up,
you figured you were home free.Too bad they want
a parking lot there now.It's coincidence.That's all.I guess I need a lawyer.Update for you.Forensics is back on the
hair found with the bodies.And?It ain't Julia's.So, there was someone else
at the scene with long, brown hair.Charlie?He was Nixon youth.Crew cut.How about Adam Clarke?Long.Yeah, but a lot of people
had long hair back then.And Adam came clean
about being an informant.FBI wasn't gonna confirm.Put himself in harm's way.Unless he practices what he preaches.People who win face the real facts
of whatever situation they're in."Maybe he looked at the odds,knew we'd make him as the informant,
with or without confirmation.So he steps out ahead of us.Make himself look good.And sets up Charlie.Audacious action, with the element of
surprise, will give you the upper hand."We know Adam followed
Charlie around for a week.He saw where he worked.Could've dumped the
bodies there one night.Which points right to Charlie
if anything ever comes to light.And Adam gets years
to have a life...till his luck runs out.We got enough to compel a DNA sample?I mean, this guy ain't gonna give it up.He already did.Those pictures,
they were real helpful, Adam.I'm glad.You're an excellent photographer.Composition, framing...Especially framing.How'd it go down, anyway?You get sloppy that day,
Julia and Gerard catch you?I... don't follow.Charlie didn't k*ll them.Good try, though.I never said he did.Adam Clarke --
real hippie or... poser?Real.My passions were very real.How'd you like having long hair?All them strands blowing around.And guess what, Adam?One of them blew right into the plastic
bags you wrapped your friends in.Got stuck under the tape.A long, brown hair that don't
belong to either of them.You think I was the only guy with long
hair those two were in contact with?Well, the DNA on this will confirm it.Whether you were a real
hippie or not doesn't matter.Your long hair got you in the end.Why'd you do it Adam?Were you against
what "Jane" was doing?I thought they were heroic.I didn't want Julia or
Gerard to be harmed.But then they found out about you.Pretty soon the whole movement would
know you were a snitch for the FBI.The Feds had me.I had no options.How about taking responsibility?Ain't that the winner's way?I was a leader in the revolution.We were living like it meant something.I loved that life.Couldn't stand to give it up.Ever wonder if Julia
and Gerard felt that way?Think they loved their lives?Hey, Jules.Gerard.What are you guys doing here?What's going on, Adam?You taking our pictures?I'm always taking pictures.Yeah, what : in the morning,
on a deserted corner?I-I don't get this.Oh, man.This is sad.He's a snitch.Come on, Adam Clarke?Who better?This is crazy, right?Let's...Let's get in the car. / Adam.Just do it, Jules.The man of peace and
love has a handgun?No, he ain't that man at all.Just get in the car.Crank the radio, Gerard.Turn it up.No.Adam, please, no...I'm sorry.
