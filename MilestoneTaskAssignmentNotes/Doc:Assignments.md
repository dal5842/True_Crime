# Documentation/Text assignments

## Project Milestone 2: Document Prep
I think I have the some basics broke down for each of us to do to get started on this project:

All of us recommended Dr B need to create a branch and work through our branches and I will just make sure to merge the requests in so when you make the pull requests can you assign them to me so I get emailed to pull them in.

Bella : 
* Can you code episode 1 - Look Again
* double check website to make sure it has all it needs (even though I am pretty sure you did it)

Emily : 
* Can you code episode 2 - Gleen

Rashe : 
*Can you code episode 4 - Churchgoing people

Dannika : 
* Code episode 3 - Our boy is back, I will also right up the readme file that’s the lot process by just using this info I’m texting to all.

~I was thinking for the breakdown of the text for just a start till we get into this more we could just break it down *between sentences
*people talking if it says names
*names
*music
*places if you can find them
- honestly we can break it down more or less 

~ I would like to ignore the new stuff we just learned for now until we have too. You can use regex or just go through the text file individually. I would like to make schemas after we turn the text files into xml. We can worry about using xsl later unless one of you find using it easier to breakdown the text files. Dr B. suggests trying to use different techniques but it is up to each of you and your preference.

~ I have pushed a text file for each episode in the repo 

~ I am not sure but I believe that bella already did most of what is needed for the html website but if not could you double check bella to make sure it is all completed. 

Lastly, it does not matter when you push bc we just need to submit the commits for the milestone and I won’t need to merge those pull requests.
