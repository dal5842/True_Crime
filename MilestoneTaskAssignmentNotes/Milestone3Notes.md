# Project Milestone Task Assignments/Meeting chats:


Hey all, sorry this is late but just looked at the repo and the stuff Emily pushed that we thought didn’t did so we could maybe try pushing to the repo in our branches just making pull requests as we go BUT make sure to keep an extra copy of it on your computer just incase things don’t push or work!!

Is everyone still good with meeting antconcw after digit to work on things and try to fix the repo with dr B?

Make sure when doing your task you create a markdown to keep track of taking notes to stay organized and then we can use those notes in the future for a website page of the thinking/breakdown process of the entire project. They do not have to been super detailed but like keep track of your sources so we can have those linked in those website pages.

Alright here is the assignment for Monday broken down of us to complete, sorry this is coming so late today be we still have all day tomorrow to work and it will be a decently small amount. 

1. Emily - You are gonna create a website page that is about the show itself like, who created, where is was filmed, the basis of the show all that stuff

1. Bella - You are gonna make the about us page for the website and develop so css 

1. Me - I am gonna create a website page for the main characters in the show, I will also create a new folder for these milestone task assignment notes.

1. Rashe - Your on making the xslt to hopefully make coding the episodes.

Since we already have broken the first four episodes down we will pause on that till we make functional xslt so that we can cut down on the time of coding the text files into xml. We also have been creating markdown note files keeping track of what is done to each episode and will make notes of what is going on to keep organized. Eventually we can start to think about adding xproc and such into the project. As Emily suggested we could just the antconc to process some of these episodes in the future for the website pages and to also find hidden patterns that we did not see that we could add to the break down of the texts.
