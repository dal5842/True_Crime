We shouldn't even be out.

She's convinced planes are gonna
fall out of the sky at midnight.

I read the paper.

Come on, we've got minutes left.

I don't have a resolution.
I'm very happy with my life.

Guys, we'll have exactly one
millennium New Years in our lives,

a clean slate.

Okay.

To stop talking about my catering
business and actually start it.

Excellent.

Jill?

- Get Mel to stop gambling.
- Good luck with that.

Mel?

Start a family.

Kids and all.

That leaves you, baby.

To make Gary the starting
goalie at Whitman next year.

Your resolution is supposed
to be about you.

Forget me.

This is the century
my boy becomes a man.

To the new century.

And a brand new start.

Here here.

Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three...

Happy new year!

Hi, Gil.

This is Lilly Rush.
The lady I was telling you about.

Hi, Tami.

How are you doing?

Great. Good.

Terrible, actually.

Tami's four years sober.
She got her chip tonight.

That doesn't sound terrible to me.

It doesn't change what I did.

Which was what?

Four years ago I had hit rock bottom.

It was new year's eve, the millennium.

You know, party like it's .

So you did?

And then that night

I hit someone with my car.

She can't tell you more than that.

Tami's what they
call a blackout drunk.

But I saw on the news the next day,

a man named Greg Cardiff
was k*lled that night.

A hit and run.

I never came forward until now.

What makes you think you
did it if you can't remember?

It happened in Bella Vista.

Where I was bar
hopping that night.

After about : ,
I'm blank until the next day.

Find any damage to your car?

A dent on the hood.

A broken headlight and blood.

I think I mowed that
poor man down that night

and then just drove away.

Greg Cardiff, ,

first m*rder of the millennium.

Tami's right. This was the only
unsolved auto-ped the first half of .

Hit at the corner of th and
Christian in Bella Vista.

Pronounced at midnight.

Happy, frigging New Year.

Had a wife and a year old son.

Any witnesses?

neighborhood surveys.
Nobody saw or heard nothing.

Probably all hung over.

Be worth going back, re-interviewing.

Looks like they only talked
to of the neighbors.

This last one, Russell Brinkley didn't respond
to phone calls or cards left at the door.

Maybe out of town?
Holiday travel.

- Not a holiday now.
- Your friend still got her car?

Maybe we can match the damage
to these crime scene photos.

Nah, she hid it in a garage for a year,
then junked it in Wilmington.

But she gave us a picture.

Let's take it around. Maybe somebody
will recognize her or the car.

Bella Vista is a tight neighborhood.
Before we start knocking on doors,

we better tell the widow
we're looking back.

- Anything I can do?
- You did a lot.

Bringing us Tami.

Some AA buddy I am, huh?

Convincing her to come forward,
could land her in prison.

Mom.

It's the cops.

Detectives Rush and Valens.

What's wrong? What happened?

Nothing is wrong.
We're here about Greg.

What about him? / We may have
a new direction on the hit and run.

Gary, maybe you should...

I'm okay.

Can we show you a picture?

I'm sorry. I...

The last four years have been...

she cried for the first three.

Still wear your wedding band, huh?

No, actually, I just got
remarried a few months ago.

Congratulations.

But I'll do whatever I can to help.

Do you recognize her?

Maybe from the bar that night?

No, she doesn't look familiar,

but the jeep does.

Greg wasn't feeling well that
night so I walked him out.

Let me go back
and get Mel and Jill.

We'll drive you. / I've got to play
hockey with Gary tomorrow.

Not feeling like this.

I think I feel better.

I just got to walk. Get some air.

I'll go with you.

No, I want you to go back in and
celebrate the millennium with Jill and Mel.

I'll meet you at home.

I'll be there by : .

Hey...

See you next century.

If only I had gone with him.

Mom, how could you know?

So the jeep was outside the bar
just before midnight?

If not that one, one just like it.

What position do you play?

Goalie.

He made varsity in ninth grade.

What, is this guy deaf?

Same guy who avoided talking
to the cops first time around.

Come on, Brinkley, Open up!

- He's in there.
- Philadelphia PD!

We just saw you get the mail!

Answer this door!

I'll check around back.

I'm not leaving until
you open this door!

- Hi, there.
- Oh, crap.

Pretty much.

I didn't see anything.

This guy saw something, boss.

Something like Tami
running over Greg Cardiff?

Whatever it was,
he don't want to tell.

Unresponsive four years back.

Tried to ditch Vera
and Jeffries today.

Homebody like him, probably
wasn't out New Year's Eve.

Let me guess where you were.

Here.

How'd it go with Greg's widow?

She saw a red jeep outside
the bar that night.

Red jeep, like Tami drove.

I was hoping things
wouldn't point to her.

She's a nice lady.

Nice or not,
no one gets a free m*rder.

Vera says this guy
Russell's got demophobia.

Fear of? / Crowds.

So crowd him.

I told you I mind my own business.

Mind if we join?

More the merrier.

Russell here,

he's got a big picture window
overlooking the street where Greg got hit.

That doesn't mean I saw anything.

Detective Valens.
How are you doing?

Is there a bigger room?

This is the only one open.

Open is not what I'd call it.

It is kind of small, isn't it?

Cozy.

Even if I saw something...

- I wouldn't want to get involved.
- Why not?

It was four years ago.

You wouldn't be able
to make charges stick.

Actually our batting average
is pretty good, Russell.

And I got to live in my neighborhood.

So it was a neighbor?

A neighbor you're afraid of?

I didn't say that.

Russell, I'm appealing
to your decency here.

I think you're a decent person.

What did you see that night?

Something I wish I hadn't.

You're sure it was
a brown Continental?

Positive.

Everyone in Bella
Vista knew that car.

You saw it coming,
you went the other way.

You know the owner?

This jerk named John Butler.

- You scared of Butler?
- That make me less of a man?

Tell us about him.

He's a rotten guy, mean.

Makes life hell for
everyone who lives there.

He k*lled Harriet.

Who's Harriet?

My poodle.

Butler sicced his pitbull on her
because she chewed up his newspaper.

She was a puppy.

Are you sure he hit Greg?

Probably on purpose, too.

Oh, this guy's gonna k*ll me.

We'll protect you, Russell.

I read crime novels.

You can't do nothing.

I'm getting out of town.
You guys need me,

I'll be at my mom's in Pittsburgh.

So where were
you January , ?

Uh, at Elisa's grandma's,
scarfing the brunch of the ages.

What do you mean?

She was one of them kooks thought
the world was gonna stop spinning.

Stockpiled hams, potatoes, eggs,
enough to last days and nights.

You been with her a while,
then, huh? Elisa?

Kids when we met.

You don't believe
in making it official?

It's complicated.

Like you and Kite, right?

I guess.

She do something
you can't forgive?

Nah. She, uh...

She got sick. She...

She went to the
puzzle house for a while.

That bad, huh?

Remember that kid, uh, Barry,
on the Richardson job,

heard the voices in the closet?

Yeah.

Like him.

I hear the meds really help...

with that.

Yeah. She's having
a good run now.

Thanks

for telling me, Scotty.

This is it.

Should've brought your coat.

Yeah. / Want mine?

Wouldn't make you less of a man.

I'd rather freeze now.

We're looking for John Butler.

Thanks.

Are you Butler?

Depends who's asking.

- I am.
- I didn't do nothing to no one.

Now, why is that
so hard to believe?

You a cop, too?

Got to admire
a piece with a piece.

Maybe when we're done here,
I could buy you a steak.

Vegetarian.

John, you remember a guy from the
neighborhood named Greg Cardiff?

Knew him, till someone
turned him into roadkill.

You have a personal
relationship with Greg?

We didn't travel
in the same circles.

Because we have a witness
who saw you run him down.

Me?

We're just trying to figure
if this was an accident or m*rder.

Hey, ho. Whoever
said that is full of it.

I didn't hit no one.

Well, you were arrested
for drunk driving in ' .

Then again in ' .

So?

Not a big stretch you'd be out
drunk driving new year's eve.

Three counts
of as*ault and battery,

public nuisance complaints.

We even heard you turned your
pit bull loose on a poor little dog.

That mutt was a yappy little b*tch.

I did the neighborhood a favor.

Yeah, well, we're gonna do
the neighborhood a favor now.

Bring you in, impound your car.

I don't even have that car no more.

Matter of fact, I didn't have it
that new year's, neither.

- Convenient.
- Happens to be true.

Got stolen that night.

Hey, you got to pay first.

Three bucks a gallon? / Look, there
might not be any gas tomorrow.

I was here last week.
It was a buck and a quarter.

It, it's the owner, okay?

He says this Y K thing's got
people willing to pay big.

- That's price gouging.
- Look, you got to talk to the owner.

Hey, I been filling up here since
before you could get a woody, kid.

Look, I'm sorry, okay?
It's not up to me.

- I'm sorry.
- Turn the pump on.

Turn that pump on!

Turn your pump on!

You report your car stolen?

That night. They found it stripped
in Jersey two days later.

Check for yourself.

Will do.

Call me about that steak.

John Butler?

Everyone knows him and hates him.

Did Greg know him, too?

Unfortunately.

In fact, he saw him that afternoon.

Butler confronted us at the market.

- I was with Greg.
- This is my husband, Mel.

Mel Davis. / Hey.

Good friend of Greg's at college.

We were all together
that New Year's Eve.

The three of you?

Jill, Mel's ex-wife, was also there.

And you two are married now.

We know. It's weird.

Gary tells us all the time.

Mel was really
good to Gary and me

after we lost Greg.

And, uh, Jill left me that year
for greener pastures.

Namely, a cardiologist.

Four years later, here we are.

Nice for both of you.

I told Mel you were asking
about a red jeep.

We got new information now.

Points to Butler.

Butler drove a Continental.

Tell us about seeing him that day.

Well, Greg and
I went on a beer run,

and, uh, Butler was waiting
for us in the parking lot.

So who do you like,
Minnesota or Oregon?

Oregon's not even ranked.

Gophers are gonna destroy them.

Hey, Cardiff!

You scratched my car.

What? / Door of your
f*g-mobile nicked my door.

Are you kidding?

Was I talking to you?

I don't think I even
touched it, John.

Saw it with my own eyes.

I'm real sorry if I did.

- That don't cut it.
- Hey, idiot,

look at your car, look at Greg's.

Now, you tell me, who should
be worried about scratches?

Mel, it's not worth it.

Do you want to talk to me like that?

I'll drop both of you right here!

Whoa. Whoa. John...

I apologize, John.

Won't happen again.

Happy new year, okay?

Moron.

So Butler was looking for a fight.

Well, I got to admit,
I egged him on.

You think he hit Greg that night
on purpose to get back at him?

If he did, we'll find out.

Thought you didn't have a beef
with Greg Cardiff, John.

I didn't. / You had a run-in
with him the day he died,

bitched him out
for dinging your car.

That was nothing. / Greg and his pal
called you an idiot a moron,

and you don't seem like
the type just looks away.

I told you, my car was stolen
before Cardiff got slammed.

You made that report at : A.M.,
An hour after Greg was k*lled.

Plenty of time to ditch
the car, report it missing.

Kid at the station wouldn't let
me use the phone to call the cops.

I had to walk there.

- Yeah, we talked to that kid.
- So he'll tell you it was stolen.

He don't want to tell nothing
to help you, John, no one does.

But a lot of people are willing
to testify against you.

talk about your poor character.

We have a -year-old oak
tree in our front yard.

While we were at church,
Butler took a chainsaw to it.

That, that thing shed
its leaves onto my lawn.

Butler ran into my year old
daughter on her way to school.

- Called her a whore.
- I said they dress her that way.

Got to remember
how young boys think.

John asked me out
three or four times.

I politely declined.

He spray-painted 'whore'
on my front door.

What's your point?

What goes around comes around.

All these neighbors are gonna be
more than happy to help put you away.

You had a beef with Greg.

We got an eyewitness puts
your car at the crime scene.

And plus character witnesses
to say this guy's got to be guilty.

Look...

I'm not the guy you really want,

but I can help you.

We're listening.

My car was stolen.

But I had a guy do it for me.

Hired him, you know...

for the insurance money.

Keep talking.

He must've hit Cardiff when he was
going to ditch the car in Jersey.

Name?

Trevor McKai.

Lives over in Bridesburg.

You Trevor?

Yeah.

Homicide.

Want to talk to you about
a hit-and-run a while back.

Over in Bella Vista.

Happened New Year's Eve
at the millennium.

Were you over that way?

Hmm. Bella Vista?

Nah, I was out with friends
here in Bridesburg.

We need the names of those friends.

I don't really know their names.

So...

not good friends, then.

You know, I was just
hanging out with people.

Partying and whatnot.

Somebody's house? At a bar?

This bar, maybe?

Yeah. / Yeah?

Forget it, man.

I've been waiting four years
for you guys to show up.

Got something you want
to get off your chest?

I could tell you your rights.

Nah.

I don't need them.

It was me that hit that guy.

Driving John Butler's stolen car?

No kidding.

I had no choice.

What the hell?

Oh, god.

I hit him.

I'm not denying it.

but the man was already down.

That doesn't make sense, Trevor.

I'm telling you...

that Greg Cardiff

wasn't crossing that street.

He was lying in it.

Guy says Greg was face down
in the street before he ran him over?

- That's his story.
- Do we believe it?

Well, Trevor's got reason to lie,

but the first report did say
Greg wasn't feeling good.

That's why he went home early.

Heart attack? Aneurysm?

How about sloppy drunk?

It was New Year's Eve.

Let's ask the wife.

We didn't have this new direction,
I'd take a hard look at Susan and Mel.

I was thinking the same thing.

Anyone got a favor coming
from the coroner's office?

I ain't going to the morgue.

The smell of that place kills me.

Listen to the kitchen b*tch.

Being an auto-ped, probably didn't
do a full tox screen at autopsy, but

maybe they saved
some tissue samples.

Well, I'll give them a call.

Right after you disinfect the phone.

Greg wasn't drunk that night.
He was sick.

Sick? How?

Well, we didn't know.

It was off and on for about a month.

But he felt good that day
until we got to the bar.

What kind of symptoms he have?

Headache. Nausea. Why?

It's possible Greg collapsed on
the street before he got hit by the car.

From what? / Did he have
any kind of chronic condition?

No. He was a health nut.
He jogged every day.

He played hockey with Gary.

you know,
Gary was sick that day, too.

Same symptoms?

I think so.

Where's Gary now?

Yeah, I was sick, too.

Headache, nausea,
same as your dad?

What's that have to do
with him getting hit?

His health that night
might have been a factor.

Anything else you remember
about your symptoms?

I think I was seeing things
kind of yellow.

What do you mean?

Like...

like there was a yellow
filter over everything I saw.

So you and your dad share any
of the same foods that day?

Dad ate something that mom cooked.

And, uh, I had fast food.

How about chips or pretzels
watching the game?

No.

But there was
something else we shared.

Hey, there he is.

Good scrimmage?

Yeah.

Sorry about this morning, Gare.

That's all right.

I'm better today. How about tomorrow
we set up the net in the driveway?

Yeah, cool.

Because your mom loves when
we slam pucks against the garage.

I do love it very much.

Anyone need anything?

- No thanks, honey.
- No thanks.

- Hey, hey, hey.
- Gary, what are doing?

- You know better.
- Sorry.

You got a few years
to go there, kid.

Maybe I got sick from
drinking from the same glass.

Maybe.

So Mel and your mom were both mad
that you touched that margarita?

I didn't see what the big deal was.

It was only a sip.

Father and son drink
the same margarita,

both fall sick.

Susan and Mel are both there, both could
have slipped something into the drink.

And they take big pains
to stop the kid from drinking.

Because dad is the target.





Fast forward four years and the
widow and best friend are married.

Maybe they were seeing each other,
decided to get rid of Greg.

I want find Mel's ex.
See if she suspected an affair.

Visitor.

At least there's good
news for someone.

Why don't you go talk to Mel,
Scotty, man to man.

Hi, Tami.

Thanks for coming in.

You have news?

It wasn't you.

Oh, that's great.

You're sure?

Someone confessed
to hitting Greg Cardiff that night.

And there's an eyewitness
to back the story.

I confessed.

To what you thought you did.

What about the blood,
the damage to my car?

Maybe an animal.
Maybe you did hit someone,

injured them. But

we only have
homicide records here.

Point is,

you didn't k*ll anyone.

Did you want it to be you, Tami?

I quit drinking because
I thought I hit this guy.

That was keeping me in check.

Now I...

Now what?

I really want a gin and tonic.

We're thinking food poisoning.

And that he just fell
in front of this car?

I've seen stranger things.

Oh, crap.

You okay there, Mel?

Knocks the wind out of your sails
when you hear something like that.

He was my best friend.

Yeah.

How'd he get the food poisoning?

Maybe the margarita
he was drinking.

Really.

Gary says he took a sip of
his dad's drink that day,

and you kind of swatted
it out of his hand.

I might have.

How come?

He was only .

I mean, he's still not
old enough to drink.

Can I...

ask you an aside here?

Sure.

I ain't judging, believe me.

You and Susan...

you really take up after Greg's death?

Yeah. / Because I know if I'm
you and I'm looking at her

and she's interested back...

I mean, married or not,
the flesh is weak.

Maybe it makes me a real geek,

but no.

I was faithful.

Well, better man than me.

So, uh, the margaritas...

you remember who made them?

Rolling rock, huh?

- You guys are really living it up.
- Or it reminds us of our college days.

Wouldn't you rather
have a margarita?

Mel? / Oh, no.
I don't drink tequila.

Ever since hell night freshman year.

Mel did sh*ts in minutes.

I still get sick thinking about it.

You ended up in
student health for three days.

My parents almost
sued the fraternity.

I'm, uh, good with this.

So Susan made the margaritas,

and the margaritas made Greg sick.

I don't like what
you're suggesting.

Just adding up the facts.

Look, I'll say it again.

There was no love
triangle before Greg died.

Would your ex-wife
back that up? / Sure.

Jill's the one who
left me for another man.

Know where we can find Jill? / No.

We're out of touch.

Who was the doctor
she ended up with?

Michael... something.

Jill left you for this guy,
and you never got his name?

Look, if your wife tells you
that she's screwing another guy,

that's really all you need to know.

Anything else is just
salt in the wound.

Found Jill davis or at least
her answering machine.

Good. because Mel's either a great liar
or didn't have nothing to do with this.

Well, someone definitely
wanted Greg Cardiff dead.

Get something from the coroners?

No tissue samples,
but Greg was an organ donor.

Transplant unit at Pennsylvania Hospital
had some blood samples stored.

- Lethal levels of digoxin.
- What's that?

Medication used to stabilize
an irregular heart beat.

And it can be deadly
if you want it to be.

Overdose symptoms
are nausea, headache,

- yellow-tinted vision...
- Gary's symptoms.

And fainting. / Maybe why
Greg dropped in the street.

Guess who's in
the emergency room.

Who?

Mel davis.

Exact same symptoms as Greg.

We found digoxin in his system.

I don't know what digoxin is.

Prescription drug.

But you use it wrong,

it's just poison.

Well, I've never heard of it.

All that cooking and
catering you do, Susie,

be pretty easy to slip a few lethal
drops into dinner every night.

- I have to get to the hospital.
- Are you tired of Mel, is that it?

What?

He was good to you and all,
just like Greg.

Maybe you just had your fill of him.

- I love Mel.
- You know about black widows?

They're beautiful, but deadly.

Destroy their mates when
their usefulness is over.

I didn't hurt my husband.

You got to be more specific, Susie.
Which husband do you mean?

The one already dead,
or the one in the hospital?

If I was unhappy with Mel,
why wouldn't I just get a divorce?

I don't know.

Maybe you just
don't like confrontation.

Yellow-tinted vision?

It's weird, huh?

They're running a million tests.

Where'd you have your last meal?

Home.

Something Susan made?

So?

Mel, there was a drug called
digoxin in Greg's system.

A lethal amount.

What is that?

A heart medication.

I think they're gonna find that
in your system, too.

Your partner's already been
down this road with me.

Susan wouldn't harm me.

And she never
would have hurt Greg.

She adored him.

Maybe she adored you more.

- At least for a while.
- It was always him.

Greg was plan A.

- I'm just the one she settled for.
- But the fact remains, Mel,

you have the same
symptoms as Greg.

You know the name
of her business?

Cardiff Catering.
She still uses his name.

That's how loyal she is to him.

Hi, boss.

Jill's there?

Go ahead. I'll be there in ten.

You talking about my Jill?

Yeah.

We tracked her down.

Want me to give her a message?

No.

No message.

Mel always had it bad for Susan.

Even when you
were married to him?

I didn't like to think so,
but you know in your gut.

It's the reason why we broke up.

I thought you left him
for a cardiologist.

Only because I didn't feel like
waiting around for the affair.

Was there an affair? / No.

Susan would never leave Greg.

Wasn't until after he died
that Mel saw his opening.

Oh, yeah.
Two days after the funeral,

he wanted me to draw up papers.

Not too subtle. / No.

So, Jill, you being
married to a heart doctor,

you probably know what digoxin is.

Yeah. I take it.

I met my husband because
of my heart condition.

Hospital confirmed Mel
was poisoned with digoxin.

Just like Greg.

Probably no surprise to Susie here.

And turns out Mel's ex-wife has been
taking that drug her whole life.

- You think Jill did something?
- Jill's over Mel.

She has a new husband.

And she never had
anything against Greg.

But Mel, on the other hand...

Mel had real good access
to digoxin over the years.

Did Mel and Greg eat
a lot of meals together?

Go out drinking?

They were best friends.

According to Jill,
Mel had big plans for you

soon as Greg got out of the picture.

Who else could
it have been, Susie?

Oh, no.

You remember something?

I thought he was
just being a friend.

But even on the day
of the funeral...

Mel was moving in?

I saw a guy get a ticket on my way
to the cemetery and I just...

didn't understand.

Understand what?

How the world keeps going.

I mean, how do people do mundane
things, like write up a ticket,

when everything is over?

Hey.

Baby, I'm sorry.

I'm sorry.

It's not over.

You're gonna be happy again.

The three of us are
all going to stick together.

We're all gonna be happy.

The three of us?

When he was still married to Jill.

But why would
Mel make himself sick?

He never thought Greg's
poisoning would come out.

Knowing it would,

- he got desperate.
- Tried to set you up, Susie.

Hospital just called.

Mel davis skipped out.

Driver, remove the
keys from the ignition.

Throw the keys out of the window.

Now!

Tracked him through his cell phone.
He's not responding to orders.

So what's he doing? / Fugitives
don't usually think before they run.

My guess is, he's thinking now.

Can I try?

Mel, this is detective Rush.

Show us your hands.

Please put your hands
outside the window.

- He got a g*n?
- I don't know.

We give him much more time,
maybe we'll find out.

Careful.

I got the driver's side.

He's gone.

I'll call the coroner.

Mel wasn't thinking.

He was writing.

What's it say?

My millennium resolution
was to have a family,

kids and all.

Susan and Gary were that family.

But even after Greg was gone,
even though she married me,

I was never more than plan B.

Let's have our own toast,

just the guys.

To .

The year .

What? What is it?

I don't think Jill and
I are gonna make it.

You serious?

I couldn't say it in front of her,

but I'm gonna make
some changes in .
