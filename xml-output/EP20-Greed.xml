   <line type="dialogue">Well. To boys,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here's to
buying cheap and</line>
   <line type="dialogue">selling dear.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Selling?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I sold our positions in Navrax</line>
   <line type="dialogue">right before the plummet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why didn't you tell us?
- Couldn't risk the leak.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Timing is everything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had to get out
before the lemmings.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There he is.
- The Kipster.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have a problem.
- What now, kiddo?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're celebrating.
- It's important.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everything's important to you, Kip.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And nothing is important to you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The mouse roars.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">People are losing their
shirts on Navrax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I got my shirt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ascot Chang, it's tailor-made.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please, Charlie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have to talk.
- All right, all right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sit down.
Take a load off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Keep 'em coming, Vicky.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, sir, Mr. Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice tail on that one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To lives of quiet desperation</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and not leading them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for coming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You could've just
cancelled over the phone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cancel? And miss the chance
of seeing Tripod and Cyclops?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who says you're gonna see them?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm an optimist.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, um, this guy is a friend of
my older brother's, Randy Price.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got in the jam with the SEC, FBI.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Enron type scandal.
Now he wants to cut a deal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's got something
on the homicide?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charles Danville, .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never heard of him.
- Big financial wizard back in the day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now Randy is in danger of going
the way of Martha Stewart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you talking about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get your feet off my desk and
your a*s out of my chair, Randy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Geez, Kite.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that any way to
treat an old pal?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detective Rush,
Randy Price.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're a homicide detective?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gotta start committing
some real crimes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Enough of this white collar crap.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got something
you wanna tell me, Randy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've got something amazing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know who k*lled Charles Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, fine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't wanna solve the m*rder of
one of the biggest names on Market Street,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can take this
info elsewhere.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Door's that way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You told me this lady was
top notch, Kite.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, detective.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Before all this unpleasantness
with SEC occurred,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was senior vice president
of mergers and aquisitions.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm really busy, Randy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two weeks before Danville was k*lled,
I was in the john of this hotel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Son of a b*tch,
you lost it all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do I know you?
- Stu Livermore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I invested grand in Bentech
and now look at this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's worthless.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You run the dry cleaners.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You begged me to let you invest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because you were supposed to be
the big shot with all the inside information.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, did you read
the perspectives?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because it clearly states
the risks involved.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I need that money back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right, all right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stu, is it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">just maybe if I pull a few strings,
I can get you into Navrax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's Navrax?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's a sure thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You already wiped me out, remember?
I don't have any more money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You must think I'm really stupid.
- Not stupid, desperate.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Navrax is your way out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Trust me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't let me pressure you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You sure about this Navrax?
- Hey,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">ou got a better way out?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Take it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got a life insurance policy.
It's worth about grand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I warn you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This Navrax bombs,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you're gonna pay with your life,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">trust me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What happened to Navrax?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It crashed and burned.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two weeks after Livermore invested.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Same time Danville got k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I told you it was good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, why didn't you let the
cops know about it back then?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How would I profit from that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was saving it for a rainy day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And now, it's pouring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Theory in ' was
a car jacking gone wrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danville's body was found
in an alley off the Market Street.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I remember Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was all over the business
section back in the ' 's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His Delorean was found the next day
in Ardmore, miles away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Junked and stripped.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lotta high end cars got
jacked in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, they busted a ring of guys for
exporting car parts overseas that year.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Details of the theft match
up with the MO in all the others,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">except this one
left a victim.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And that pal of Kite's,
Randy Price..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A ' 's throw back,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a real Market Street,
'greed is good' type.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he's got information?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This story about Livermore waving
that g*n around is pretty interesting.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe Livermore shot Danville,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">took the Delorean to
make it look like a car jacking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Scotty and I'll track down Livermore,
see what he has to say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Want me and Vera to go talk
to the last-to-see?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who was it?
- Victoria Jordan,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">called Arbitrage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've been there
with my stockbroker.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're in the market, boss?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Half of America is, Lil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not my half.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll give my broker a call,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">see what he know about Danville
and company he used to work for.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stu Livermore?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives Rush
and Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, finders keepers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It ain't illegal colllecting
discarded tickets.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We wanna talk to you
about Charles Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That lying huckster ruined my life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We heard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You been talking to my ex.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She told us
where to find you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You had a run-in with him
June, th, .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Swore that if Navrax bombs,
you'd k*ll him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think I made
good on that threat?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You shoved the g*n to his chest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Should've fired it too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But instead I invested
another grand with him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two weeks later,
that was gone too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mr. Livermore?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey. Kip Krowley,
I'm an associate of Mr. Danville's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't want an associate,
I want Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mr. Danville is
extremely busy. / Yeah,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">busy robbing on
his people like me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went to the headquarters
in Navrax Corporation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know what I found?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One old lady in an -by-
office answering the phone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's Navrax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">An old lady with a phone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You..You must be mistaken.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No mistake. / Well, I'm sure
that there's an explanation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That money was going to
pay for my children's education.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My wife's gonna leave me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd k*ll myself,
but that wouldn't do any good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've already cashed in
on my life insurance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, I..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm very sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please, I'm begging you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I don't get that money back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just.. you give me your number,
Mr. Livermore, okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I personally gurantee Mr. Danville
will look into this and call you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When?
- End of the day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tomorrow morning at the latest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I give you my word.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was sitting by the phone
all that day like a chump</line>
   <line type="dialogue">waiting for that kid to come through.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got the brush-off.
I finally went to bed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I saw the story on
the morning news.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you never got
your money back?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guess I could've hired a lawyer,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if I had a cent to my name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I didn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Still don't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were the last person
to see Charles Danville alive?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, around two am.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Saw him walk out that door
like every night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyone with him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nope.
Lost Boys left earlier.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lost Boys? / Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danville had a group of young
boys that worshipped him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fed his ego. / From Collins Brothers,
the firm where he worked?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They wished.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danville's boys weren't Ivy League.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were wannabes.
On the outside looking in,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">until Danville took pity on them
about a month before he died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had met them before? / No,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not that I knew of at least,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but he got real friendly, real fast.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wonder when
I'll ever be those boys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Galaxy far far away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go get some stock tips.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holy crap,
that is Charles Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's.. he's coming our way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Be cool.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mr. Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can we buy you a drink?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You guys from Blaine?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, but how could you tell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, to start,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're dressed like
used car salesmen,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you're at the bar, because</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you can only
afford an appetizer</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and you're gawking at the swells</line>
   <line type="dialogue">like they're different species.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which they are.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Except for me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I used to work in a sweat shop
just like Blaine back in the day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cold caling chumps for
ten dollar commissions.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So how did you get to
where you are?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cajones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Big brass ones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You guys got 'em?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, we got going it. Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good. Cause if you're hungry,
maybe I can help you out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Seriously?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm putting together a bond offering
for a company called Navrax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know Navrax?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, of course.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Navrax is awesome.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're crappy liars.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you'll get better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stick with me, I'll teach you
how to sell snow to eskimos.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'll be millionaires
by the end of summer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Interested?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why would a big shot like Danville
wanna associate with nobodies?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he saw himself
in those boys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he was just slumming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All I know was,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the day he died, we got stuck
with thousand dollar tab.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">grand,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">worth more than my car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Way more.
- Owner of the Arbitage at the time,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he thought Danville was
made of money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just too busy to get
around to paying it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Me, I would never
have let that happen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The owner still around?
- Sold the place, to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I don't give credit to no one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Four bucks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Mackie's your broker, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He told you where to find me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Danville worked for you
for what, six years?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thought he got k*lled
in the car jacking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, we're taking
another look at that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My detectives talked
to a woman at the Arbitrage</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and said the guy was a louse,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">welched on his debts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds about right.
- I thought Danville was a heavy hitter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rolling in dough.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For a while.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then he hit a losing streak.
Every stock he hyped went in the toilet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why we fired him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fired?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wasn't he still the employee
of the Collins Brothers when he died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">On paper, he was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he begged us to let
him stay unsalaried</line>
   <line type="dialogue">until he can get another gig going.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Danville was on the ropes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Day he died, we had to cover
about half a mil of his debts</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to protect the firm's reputation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Keep up the appearances.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And keep the authorities off
our backs checking records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fat lot of good
it did us considering</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got popped for insider trading.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, it could've been worse.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You could've ended up like Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Broke? / Dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Danville's broke
but still playing the big shot?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, scrambling to get the
Navrax deal off the ground</line>
   <line type="dialogue">while his reputation's still intact and</line>
   <line type="dialogue">at Collins Brothers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So this guy's all tabbed out,
but he's still got a corporate apartment,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and a Delorean to push around?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do I get this job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, how come the assigned didn't look
at the disgruntled investors for this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Car jacking theory looked solid.
- Collins Brothers covered for Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They erased the
paper trail of his debts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And plus white collar criminal
ususally get sued, not shot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, maybe the doer isn't
your typical investor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's check the SEC records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">See if anyone with a criminal
record bought shares with Navrax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll go talk to Danville's
old associates.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Lost boys. / Start with the kid that
was supposed to get back to Livemore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kip.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kip Krowley?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detective Rush and Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's about Charles Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie Danville?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was a life time ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We've been talking to an old
associate of yours,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Randy Price.
- Oh yeah, I read about Randy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's in trouble with the SEC, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He says Stu Livermore
threatened Danville's life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No kidding.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know you dealt with Livermore
in ' running interference for Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you never told
the cops about that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, Charlie was k*lled
in a car jacking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What would Livermore
have to do with that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you know he pulled
a g*n on Danville</line>
   <line type="dialogue">two weeks before his death?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I didn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just felt bad for the guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you talk to him?
Is he making out?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's collecting used tickets
off the floor at the OTB.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a shame.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I tried to talk to Charlie
about him the night that he died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To lives of a quiet desperation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And not leading them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, kiddo.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's so important that can't wait?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went to the headquarters
at the Navrax Corporation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This about the drycleaner mope?
- Livermore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he was right.
It's nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing. It's an old lady
answering phones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's the idea that counts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not the the brick and mortar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I promised Livermore that
you would call him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I personally guaranteed..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't promise things, kiddo.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you help him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kip.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Going for the heart like that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I actually have taught you something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you will talk to him? / No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm a heartless bastard, remember?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, you're not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You are too good to be true.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kiddo, have a drink.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lighten up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was the last time that I saw him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I walked to the train and
went to my mom's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danville sounds like he was telling the
truth about being a heartless bastard, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, that was just his way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was training me to be like him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Were you upset when he died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Broken up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like I said,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he was trying to
teach me to suceed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wasn't his fault I couldn't
cut it in his world.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These are records from the SEC.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">About people invested
in Navrax back in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Most for a thousand bucks or so.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And only a dozen
went in for grand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyone with a record?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, one.
Teddy Mars.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Served years for dealing
cocaine in the late ' 's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And another three for manslaughter,
broke a guy's neck in Frackville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How does a ?? like Mars get into
business with a highroller like Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If he was selling
cocaine to Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danville was broke.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe there was
some bartering going on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And cocaine for stocks?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And if those investments tanked?
- Mars would come collecting.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The old fashioned way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Check with his parole officer
see if he's got a good address.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Teddy Mars.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wanna talk to you about
Charles Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ain't Vice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you don't look like Narcs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Homicide. / You invested grand in the
complany Danville was selling called Navrax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hold up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let me get my lawyer down here.
We can have a real nice pow wow,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">just the four of us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">While you're on the line,
we'll talk to your boys over there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What boys?

   <line type="dialogue">You got me wrong detectives.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm an artist now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Suit yourself, Teddy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">With what they're holding,
you're coming with us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So how'd you get
involved with Danville?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That ain't a secret.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For a time I supplied
all the joints in Market Street.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Including Arbitrage?
- Especially Arbitrage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Them Brooks Brothers types
liked to party.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Teddy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You should get on
this Navrax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Make some fortune.
- You wanna taste the merchandise?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How much for the whole ounce?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Boys deserve a treat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ounce is three grand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You already owe me ten.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know what,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna cut you in on
this Navrax deal for thousand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Couple of months,
it'll be worth twice that,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, you do that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After you pay me
the grand in cash.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll give that think through. / Teddy,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">- this Navrax is like money in the bank.
- You don't got it, do you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm offering you grand
in bonds for .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Give me your Rolex.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Teddy, come on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Imma take your watch</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and your worthless paper.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But hours,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I want my K in cash.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So did you get your money?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Next day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One of Charlie's boys
delivered a briefcase full of green.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You happen to remember
who gave you the money?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, the pretty boy.
Beau something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, if you don't believe me, ask him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'd tell you.
I got paid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't k*ll Charlie.
Cuz I had no reason to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I may have met a Mr. Mars
back in the ' 's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I couldn't say for sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're Homicide, Beau.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not Narcotics.
- Or the SEC.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, yeah, I remember Teddy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was our supplier.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Danville send you to him
with a briefcase full of money?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he was pissed about it too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were coining it on Navrax,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but Charlie hated to
part with the actual cash.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So why did he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cuz Charlie could take the heat
from the blue ?? ladies or ??.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Teddy Mars was
a different story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you knew Danville was a swindler?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I looked the other way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You any other investors that
might want to see Danville dead?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Investors?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then who?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After I gave Teddy the cash,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went back to Charlie to
return his Rolex.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Our brave boy,
back from the trenches.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The guy scared the piss out of me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sit down,
take a load off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Help yourself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got your watch back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I want you to keep it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Token of my appreciation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Seriously.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're the one, Beau.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're the one who's
gonna make it big.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I am? / I don't think
the others have what it takes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you know what it takes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's when I got out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danville hit on anyone else
you know of?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He hit on all of us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If you wanted to succeed with Charlie,
you play by his rules.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And that meant sleeping with him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If you wanted to get ahead,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that's what it meant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Want a deal, Randy,
you start talking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you tell all.
No more saving for a rainy day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Livermore didn't k*ll Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know what I heard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know what we heard?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Danville liked boys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Young ones.
Up-and-comers, like you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He hit on you, Randy?
Cuz he hit on Beau.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, but Beau didn't k*ll him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's got an alibi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was at his girlfriend's
the night Danville got dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you, you don't
have a alibi, do you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wait a minute.
You think I k*lled Danville?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's insane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, you like biting the pillow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't get horizontal
to make it to Homicide?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guy's worthless.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This deal's off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, okay.
Cool your jets.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">God.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did I service Danville to get ahead?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, so what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So maybe you felt
humiliated by that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Decided to g*n down the man
who made you catch for him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I did what I had to do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Big deal.
- You got anything more on Danville,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you wanna say it right now, Randy.
Cuz your deal is going south, fast.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is the entire truth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that's big for Randy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I met Danville earlier
than I said before.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How much earlier?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Little more than a month
before he was k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You want a ride?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, you're Charles Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you work for Blaine &amp; Sons.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do you know that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I used to have a crappy
umbrella just like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hop in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is so cool.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Took me hard days
of work to afford it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you think I'm kidding?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, I used to work
for a joint like Blaine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Back in the day.
- Seriously?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Till I wised up,
took some risks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You a risk taker, uh..?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Randy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Randy Price.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I like risk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good, Randy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then I'm gonna
make you a proposition.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna create a company
at thin air, sell the hell out of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you do that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm Charles Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can do anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Still looking for a couple salesmen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know anyone
who might be interested?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Danville meeting you,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kip and Beau at the Arbitrage,
that was a setup?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yep. Worked like a charm, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Beau and Kip never knew
Navrax was bogus?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Beau knew it was
a boiler room scam,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but he didn't care
so long as he making out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Kip?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kip was a fool.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Out of his depth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Believed every word Danville said.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why'd you keep
this from us, Randy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because it was a crooked deal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I'm facing charges of
invested fraud.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, you know what,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just remembered something.
And this is good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, feel that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's raining again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kip Krowley the dummy,
he got his mother to invest in Navrax</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and she lost a bundle.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh we've seen the list of investors,
there's no Krowley.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, Danville told me she invested.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He bragged about closing the deal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, your boyfriend in there
was telling the truth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's too bad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kip's mum did invest in Navrax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She went by Mavis Breen,
not Krowley.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How much'd she drop? grand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's worth a conversation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What? You got plans?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kind of.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got plans?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You kidding?
I'm married.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd take any excuse
not to go home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wish you boys would've
given me some warning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Would've made myself presentable.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We just wanted to ask you
about Navrax, Mrs. Breen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mavis, please.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm divorced.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you tell us how you came
to invest in the company, Mavis?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'd have to
ask Kip about Navrax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, we'd rather talk to you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kip isn't in any trouble, is he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cuz if he is,
it's my fault.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And how does that work?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, when it comes to men,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I make terrible choices.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And poor Kip had to suffer
through my divorces ??</line>
   <line type="dialogue">all four of them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, about Navrax,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kip told you to invest?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He knew I had some money in
the bank from my last settlement.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He just wanted to help me grow it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you ever meet Charles Danville?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He took Kip and me to dinner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, to make his pitch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Chin chin.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What is this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that is called sushi, Ms. Breen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, it's Mavis.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why isn't it cooked?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, it's cutting edge.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Raw's the next big thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I prefer chicken teriyaki.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mum., Charlie has a great
investment opportunity for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's a company called Navrax, Mavis.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">High tech.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Japanese are interested
in investing, right, Charlie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I promise you
it has nothing to do with sushi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie's a genious, mum.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's a senior VP at Collins Brothers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've heard of Collins Brothers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm old news.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kip here is the future.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No thanks to you, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I may have helped out a little bit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie is my mentor, mum.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You flatter me, kiddo.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I certainly appreciate
your taking interest in my boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But when it comes to investing,
I'm all for cautious.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, your mum's just my lady, Kip.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's obviously going
to take more than one dinner</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to get her to see the
wisdom of investing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, Danville convinced you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Eventually.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I really invested for Kip's sake.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, to help
advance his career.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lot of good that did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You must've been pretty angry
losing all that money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Furious.
- How about Kip?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was devastated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He really believed in that Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So in your defense,
he took revenge on Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh no, my Kip couldn't hurt a fly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Me, on the other hand,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanted to string Danville
up by his lying neck.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But of course I didn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Man was dad
before I could buy a rope.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your friend Price is a real prince.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's my brother's friend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he's always been a low life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, he's saint
compared to Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's the j.o.b.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We don't get to pick our victims.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, you</line>
   <line type="dialogue">wanna go see another
movie tomorrow night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's first Thursdays, tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">First what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">First Thursday of every month,
the homicide detectives get together,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To do what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Talk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Drink.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds fun,
bring me along.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know, Kite.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're not in the Hat Squad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You guys have more weird
names for yourselves.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's usually just cops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I'm a friend of a cop.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna see the girls?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Met your mum, Kip.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You did. / Heard how she lost
a cool K to Navrax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh boy. / You forgot to
mention that to us, did ya.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I didn't tell you because I thought
it would look like I k*lled Charlie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It does.
- And that's just the half of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you mean?
- Randy Price, Beau Munger,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">they say Danville was
a sexual predator.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They said that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, Kip.
Quit the act.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You worshipped Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not only did he use you
to get to your mum's money..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He hit on you too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's not how it went.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You really think I should buy it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell yes, I think you should buy it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe I should save the money
that we're making off Navrax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, no, kiddo.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's plenty more
where that came from.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I do love it.
- Then buy it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You derserve it. / Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm really proud of you, you know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You've come a long way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, kiddo,
you stick with me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're gonna rule
Market Street one day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Follow right in my footsteps.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, kiddo.
Let's grab the bull by its horns.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gotta tell you something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The car's not the
only thing that I love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I love you, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I love you, too, kiddo.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I mean</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I really love you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie didn't hit on me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hit on him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now that must've surprised Danville.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was surprised.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But then we fell in love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You buy that Mustang?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie and I drove
all over town in it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanted to spend the rest
of my life with him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So the thought of me k*lling him is so crazy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I loved him,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I still do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, Kip said he took trains to
his mum's the night, Danville died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.
- There's a reason.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ran all the car jackings
in June of ' ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">no mustang is stole in Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But in Montgomery county
where Kip's mum lived..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cherry red mustang?
- Junked and stripped.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guess where?
- Ardmore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just like all the other
car jackings.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Including Danville's Delorean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pretty amazing coincidence.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd they miss this in ' ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Montgomery County and Philly
were like two separate countries, Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So maybe Kip's playing us
using love as a alibi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's bring the math teacher
in this time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">See whether he likes our house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is wrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why are you doing this to me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's excellent.
- Sure you don't teach drama?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm telling you the truth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't k*ll Charlie.
Why do you think that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, cuz your precious
cherry red Mustang was car jacked</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a few days before Charlie was k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you knew exactly how
to cover up a m*rder</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and make it look like
a car jacking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was it spur of the moment, Kip,
or premeditated?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I left Charlie at the Arbitrage alive</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and then I went to the train station
jsut like I told you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I believe you left the bar, Kip.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then you waited outside for
Danville to leave.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shot him twice and took off
in his Delorean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, that's not what happened.
- So what did happen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The night he was k*lled I,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I kept at him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I confronted him one last time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're having
a conversation here, Kip.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not leaving till we talk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's bothering you now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If you won't help Livermore..
- Get over Livermore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">At least tell me that the
thousand my mum invested,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you're not gonna scam her too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your mum already received
a return on her investment.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ask her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie, you're really
confusing me here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is, is my mother gonna get
her money back or not?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, Kip.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But she's my mother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And she is not some stranger
like Livermore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought that you cared
about us, I mean me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I do, kiddo.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why you need to listen
to me very closely.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This game ain't for you.
Get out while you're still young.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go back to the sticks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Become a librarian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something more your speed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're kidding, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanted to help you
but you're just not catching on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie.
- It's over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No sale.
- But I love you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So long, kiddo.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I left there crying like a baby.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never saw Charlie again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Says you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went to my mum's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like I told you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When it comes to alibis,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a mother's pretty close to worthless.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't confess to
a m*rder I didn't commit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why don't you believe me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you doing here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kip's in custody for m*rder
