   <line>Mitchell?</line>
   <line>Mitchell? Mitchell?</line>
   <line>Mitchell?</line>
   <line>She ask for Homicide?</line>
   <line>She can't ask for nothing.
She's loony tunes.</line>
   <line>Carrying around an orbit of
a guy that died in .</line>
   <line>Covering my ass....
I called you.</line>
   <line>Why's she locked up?</line>
   <line>She kept wandering away.</line>
   <line>Come on, Silvan,
get her out of there.</line>
   <line>Son's on the way.</line>
   <line>She had his number in her pocket.</line>
   <line>Hi, Ma'am.</line>
   <line>So many cuts.</line>
   <line>So many cuts.</line>
   <line>So....so many cuts.</line>
   <line>You want to come out?</line>
   <line>Poor... Poor Mitch....</line>
   <line>Poor Mitch.... Mitch...
- Who's Mitch?</line>
   <line>Couldn't have a church funeral...
not with all those cuts.</line>
   <line>Nuttier than a fruitcake.
- Mitch was a good man.</line>
   <line>Was Mitch your husband?</line>
   <line>Mitchell Bayes served as
organist and musical director</line>
   <line>of St. Anthony's Episcopal
church in Roxborough..."</line>
   <line>Here's the son.</line>
   <line>Mom, you can't do this.
You can't leave the house.</line>
   <line>I don't think anyone's
pressing charges,</line>
   <line>over at Holy Field Cemetery.</line>
   <line>I'm sorry, I'll keep a better eye out.</line>
   <line>Come on.</line>
   <line>That where your dad was buried?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>It's okay. It's okay.</line>
   <line>She was talking about him.</line>
   <line>He was m*rder*d?</line>
   <line>years ago.</line>
   <line>She's been going back there a lot lately.</line>
   <line>Doctor says it's something about
older memories becoming more present.</line>
   <line>It's Alzheimer's?</line>
   <line>Might wanna get her
one of those bracelets.</line>
   <line>I ordered one.</line>
   <line>She was carrying these.</line>
   <line>We ever get the guy?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>Come on, Mom.</line>
   <line>Come on. Let's go.</line>
   <line>It's okay. It's okay.</line>
   <line>What's an ' job doing next to a ' ?</line>
   <line>Civillian workers going the extra mile.</line>
   <line>So how'd this guy die?</line>
   <line>Stabbed by a hooker was the theory.</line>
   <line>Here it is. Bayes, ' .</line>
   <line>Why are we looking at this?</line>
   <line>The lady was so distressed.</line>
   <line>I just wondered why
we didn't bring the job in.</line>
   <line>Mitch Bayes, .</line>
   <line>Stabbed times.</line>
   <line>Wallet was gone.</line>
   <line>Presumed robbery-homicide.</line>
   <line>Never found a w*apon?</line>
   <line>No, they never even
named a good suspect.</line>
   <line>Bump in the night.</line>
   <line>Let's take this upstairs.</line>
   <line>So is this a regular thing
now? Working cold jobs?</line>
   <line>I am. You can stay
on the line if you want.</line>
   <line>I guess cold cases aren't less
important than new ones.</line>
   <line>They're more important.</line>
   <line>They're been waiting longer.</line>
   <line>Any limits on how far back we can look?</line>
   <line>No limits.</line>
   <line>There's some problems
with this job, boss.</line>
   <line>Unsolved is always a problem, Lil.</line>
   <line>The ME reports and the
body chart don't match.</line>
   <line>Plus the inventory of
the clothes in the van.</line>
   <line>Pants, underwear, shirt,
shoes... but no socks.</line>
   <line>Uh-huh.</line>
   <line>That was February.</line>
   <line>You don't go anywhere
in February without socks.</line>
   <line>Maybe they were inventoried wrong?</line>
   <line>Whatever happened,
this case was a rush job.</line>
   <line>The assigned chalked it up
to a solicitation gone bad.</line>
   <line>Pretty much left it at that.</line>
   <line>This is a nice lady, boss.</line>
   <line>And her memory's going fast. If
we're ever going to look at this again...</line>
   <line>We should do it now.</line>
   <line>Who's the assigned?
- Gil Sherman.</line>
   <line>This was a typical job
during the crack era.</line>
   <line>Guy comes 'round looking
for some company,</line>
   <line>ends up robbed and k*lled by the girl.</line>
   <line>Why'd you think it was a hooker?</line>
   <line>Ever been to Kensington
Avenue, darling?</line>
   <line>That's hookerland.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I grew up in Kensington.</line>
   <line>So what was he doing there,
seeing the sights?</line>
   <line>You don't have this back wound
marked on your bodychart.</line>
   <line>So I missed it.</line>
   <line>You ever miss a wound?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>What did forensics show you?</line>
   <line>Forensics were screwed. Rained
like a son of a b*tch that night.</line>
   <line>Whole scene got soaked.</line>
   <line>He was in the back of a van.</line>
   <line>They should have had some
evidence to work with.</line>
   <line>Partial prints on vials.
Inconclusive.</line>
   <line>So there were no suspects at all?</line>
   <line>Plenty of suspects.</line>
   <line>Whores, dealers, homeless.</line>
   <line>Nothing stuck.</line>
   <line>So that was it. End of case?</line>
   <line>Look, Rush... these murders
were a dime a dozen that year.</line>
   <line>crackheads thought nothing
of icing a guy for bucks.</line>
   <line>Next night the same job all over again.</line>
   <line>You remember.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>I felt for this family though.</line>
   <line>They were decent people.</line>
   <line>I had to tell 'em on a Sunday morning....</line>
   <line>We found him in his vehicle</line>
   <line>just off of Kensington Avenue.</line>
   <line>I don't understand why he'd be there.</line>
   <line>There's a lot of activity in that area.</line>
   <line>What kind of activity?</line>
   <line>Like that.</line>
   <line>Mitch wouldn't be
there. / I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>No, Mitch didn't use
dr*gs, or prostitues.</line>
   <line>We are churchgoing people.</line>
   <line>I understand.</line>
   <line>He didn't use.... prostitutes.</line>
   <line>Bayes was a hypocrite church type.</line>
   <line>Whoring Saturday night,
asking forgiveness on Sunday.</line>
   <line>Son's meeting us here?</line>
   <line>Maybe he's already here.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I'm not sure
where they went exactly.</line>
   <line>No, I...</line>
   <line>I'm not sure.</line>
   <line>I..Yes.</line>
   <line>Okay.</line>
   <line>I'll... I'll tell them.</line>
   <line>When they.</line>
   <line>Okay, I'll make sure
I tell them. / Hello.</line>
   <line>They're home now...</line>
   <line>Hi, Charlotte.</line>
   <line>T-Tina.</line>
   <line>No, no, Lily.</line>
   <line>Remeber we talked about Mitch?</line>
   <line>Mitchell Bayes served as
organist and musical director</line>
   <line>at St. Anthony's Episcopal
church in Roxborough..."</line>
   <line>Oh. You're here.</line>
   <line>Did Mom let you in?</line>
   <line>The door was open, Ryan.</line>
   <line>Was she trying to leave?</line>
   <line>No, she was just talking to herself.</line>
   <line>She has good days and bad days.</line>
   <line>Can't have a church funeral
for Mitch... / Okay.</line>
   <line>Just can't.</line>
   <line>Why is she talking about Dad?</line>
   <line>I brought him up.</line>
   <line>We're looking at his case again, Ryan.</line>
   <line>I'll do what I can to help.</line>
   <line>I was only , you know.</line>
   <line>Do you know if your dad
had any enemies?</line>
   <line>Maybe someone
from work, or church?</line>
   <line>No, he worked at Drexel Insurance.</line>
   <line>I think it was pretty mundane.</line>
   <line>At church all he had was friends.</line>
   <line>Were you surprised to hear he
was found on Kensington Avenue?</line>
   <line>We were all shocked by that.</line>
   <line>Including your Mom?</line>
   <line>I think it was the humiliation of her life.</line>
   <line>Could we try to talk to
her about that night?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>It'll be tricky. She kind
of goes in and out.</line>
   <line>Mom. Mom.</line>
   <line>We're gonna talk about dad, okay?</line>
   <line>About the night he died.</line>
   <line>Okay...Mitch...</line>
   <line>He died, Mitch died...</line>
   <line>Remember we had dinner as a family?</line>
   <line>And I was going to a school formal,</line>
   <line>and I was worried
because I couldn't dance.</line>
   <line>I'll teach you.</line>
   <line>You remember that?</line>
   <line>Anyone can dance...</line>
   <line>Cheers.</line>
   <line>Okay, now let me show
you how it's dance.</line>
   <line>Come on. Come on.</line>
   <line>Aw, loosen up, sweetie..</line>

   <line>My best gal.</line>
   <line>Thanks.</line>
   <line>Go easy on him, Charlotte.
He's got a real date tonight.</line>
   <line>Started out as a nice night.</line>
   <line>Who was the phone call from?</line>
   <line>I don't remember a phone call.</line>
   <line>Your mom does.</line>
   <line>Huh?</line>
   <line>Maybe she's adding
that detail in her mind.</line>
   <line>Embellishing, you know?</line>
   <line>To be honest, I'm still learning
about what's happening to her.</line>
   <line>Ryan, could we get
your sister's address?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Diabetes don't scare you enough,</line>
   <line>you got to add somking
to your health problem?</line>
   <line>Thanks, Lil.</line>
   <line>You know what? I don't
hear that enough at home.</line>
   <line>I got that.</line>
   <line>You're Tina, right?</line>
   <line>Who are you?</line>
   <line>Detective Rush and Lassing, Homicide.</line>
   <line>We wanna talk about your dad.</line>
   <line>No, thanks.</line>
   <line>We know he dropped you
at a friend's house that night.</line>
   <line>I'm not talking to any
cops. / How come?</line>
   <line>You guys dicided a long
time ago how my dad died.</line>
   <line>Why you got to bring it up again?</line>
   <line>We just want to hear
about that night.</line>
   <line>What your dad said to you?</line>
   <line>You mean, like, did he say,</line>
   <line>Bye, darling, I'm going
to see my hooker"?</line>
   <line>You think that's where he went?</line>
   <line>I never thought that.</line>
   <line>Tina, we're looking for answers here.
You can't give us five minutes?</line>
   <line>Your mom and brother helped us.</line>
   <line>They'd like you to do the same.</line>
   <line>I haven't talked to my mom
or brother in eight years.</line>
   <line>So I could really care
less what they'd like.</line>
   <line>He was parked here.</line>
   <line>Found at : A.M. by a homeless
guy looking for someplace to sleep.</line>
   <line>So you're calling this a crime scene?</line>
   <line>This is where it happened.</line>
   <line>Rush, that was years ago.</line>
   <line>We ain't got much to work
with, Lil. / It's what we got.</line>
   <line>You're standing next to the
best scene man I know,</line>
   <line>but I don't think there's
blood in that stone.</line>
   <line>Take a picture.</line>
   <line>Gotta go find the girls that Sherman
talked about Mitch Bayes.</line>
   <line>Hey, girls.</line>
   <line>You know this guy?</line>
   <line>Naw.</line>
   <line>Uh-uh.</line>
   <line>Sure, you don't.</line>
   <line>probably playing hopscotch in .</line>
   <line>Any girls out here with some age on 'em?</line>
   <line>Delores, Rhona, Rhono, Mary?</line>
   <line>Delores....</line>
   <line>She's, like, .</line>
   <line>That is old.</line>
   <line>You know where we can find her?</line>
   <line>Works the alley.</line>
   <line>She only do oral now.
'Cause of HIV.</line>
   <line>Thanks.</line>
   <line>She's got HIV or she
doesn't want to get it?</line>
   <line>I don't need to know.</line>
   <line>Delores?</line>
   <line>Delores?</line>
   <line>Yeah,Yeah. That's me.</line>
   <line>Remember this guy, Delores?</line>
   <line>Mitch Bayes?</line>
   <line>Yeah. Yeah, that guy died down
there behind the Dumpster.</line>
   <line>Is he a trick of yours?</line>
   <line>No, I've never seen him
before. Nobody had.</line>
   <line>Know where I can find
a Rhona or Mary?</line>
   <line>Rhona moved back to Delaware,
to her Mom's where her kids are at.</line>
   <line>Mary got the AIDS.</line>
   <line>She died, like, a year ago.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>That looks kind of funny, you know?</line>
   <line>Funny how?</line>
   <line>I never seen a guy take all
his clothes off for a girl</line>
   <line>and leave 'em in the
corner all tidy like that?</line>
   <line>Right.</line>
   <line>Thanks, Delores.
Take care of yourself.</line>
   <line>She's right.</line>
   <line>The scene's off.</line>
   <line>There are a lot of props:
the crack vials, the magazines.</line>
   <line>It's all wrong.</line>
   <line>Mitch Bayes didn't hang out here.</line>
   <line>We gotta redeem this guy.</line>
   <line>Henry Walsh, his name's on
one of these porn rags</line>
   <line>that was found in the van.</line>
   <line>He's not in your file.
Do you know who he is?</line>
   <line>Great, Sherman. Got to run.</line>
   <line>A simple yes or no
don't work for Sherman.</line>
   <line>I take it he didn't auto-track Walsh.</line>
   <line>Probably too busy will
all the crack going on.</line>
   <line>You guys again?
- You were right, Tina.</line>
   <line>About what?</line>
   <line>Your dad didn't go with
a hooker that night.</line>
   <line>How do you know?</line>
   <line>We think someone drove him
to that ally after they k*lled him.</line>
   <line>That cop told us...
- That cop was wrong.</line>
   <line>I knew it.</line>
   <line>I knew my dad was too good for that.</line>
   <line>You were close, huh?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>We're looking for the truth here, Tina.</line>
   <line>Can you help us and talk to us?</line>
   <line>About what?</line>
   <line>Start with the night he died.</line>
   <line>Was there a phone call?</line>
   <line>Nice families don't talk
about these things.</line>
   <line>Tina, what things?</line>
   <line>What was the phone call?</line>
   <line>It was for him.</line>
   <line>Do you know who it was?</line>
   <line>I had an idea.</line>
   <line>I know where you're going now.</line>
   <line>I'm going home.</line>
   <line>No, you're not.</line>
   <line>What are you talking about?</line>
   <line>Don't go.
Call her and say no.</line>
   <line>T-Tina!</line>
   <line>Go on in the house. I can
see Cindy's waiting for you.</line>
   <line>You're always talking about
what's a sin and all that.</line>
   <line>This is a sin, dad,</line>
   <line>what you're doing with Judy.</line>
   <line>You get out of this car.</line>
   <line>That was our last conversation.</line>
   <line>Who was Judy?</line>
   <line>I don't know.</line>
   <line>I just heard him talking
on the phone to her.</line>
   <line>After he died, I thought</line>
   <line>maybe it was a prost*tute that....</line>
   <line>Do you think your mom
knew about Judy?</line>
   <line>I wouldn't know that.</line>
   <line>Maybe you should go
with us to see your mom.</line>
   <line>Ask her about this woman?</line>
   <line>Why don't you ask her?</line>
   <line>Your probably would have a better chance
of getting through with her condition.</line>
   <line>What condition?</line>
   <line>Your brother says it's Alzheimer's.</line>
   <line>You're probably going to have
to help the conversation along.</line>
   <line>Don't worry.</line>
   <line>The door's open again.</line>
   <line>Mom?</line>
   <line>Oh, God...Mom.</line>
   <line>It's Tina.</line>
   <line>Ba-ba.</line>
   <line>Mom?</line>
   <line>We'll give you a minute, Tina.</line>
   <line>All these locks...</line>
   <line>what's that about?</line>
   <line>I wish you would comb your hair.</line>
   <line>She knows me now.</line>
   <line>Can we talk to her?</line>
   <line>Mom, we want to talk about Judy.</line>
   <line>Judy...</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Judy and Dad.</line>
   <line>Judy...</line>
   <line>I never,</line>
   <line>never cared for Judy.</line>
   <line>I never cared for Judy.</line>
   <line>Judy.</line>
   <line>Who was she, Charlotte?</line>
   <line>How did you know her?</line>
   <line>Judy Enright.</line>
   <line>I never cared for Judy Enright.</line>
   <line>Charlotte, it's okay.</line>
   <line>It's okay.</line>
   <line>What's going on here?</line>
   <line>Never cared for Judy...</line>
   <line>What are you doing here?</line>
   <line>I just... I thought I'd come...</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>I don't know.</line>
   <line>We asked her to come.</line>
   <line>Well, I'm asking you to leave.</line>
   <line>They believed me about dad, Ryan.</line>
   <line>Good for you.</line>
   <line>Congratulations.</line>
   <line>I really do want to help you,
but I'm not coming back here.</line>
   <line>She always, always has the solos.</line>
   <line>She always...</line>
   <line>She always has the solos.</line>
   <line>You shouldn't have come here.</line>
   <line>Strangers upset her.
- We thought with Tina....</line>
   <line>You thought wrong.
- The most talented singer...</line>
   <line>She was talking to us about Judy.</line>
   <line>That name mean anything to you?</line>
   <line>No. Look, you should know my
sister has emotional problems.</line>
   <line>She's been hospitalized a few times</line>
   <line>and sometimes she says things
that aren't necessarily true.</line>
   <line>You should know your front
door was open again, Ryan.</line>
   <line>Tina says your dad was
close to this woman.</line>
   <line>And I told you that she
has mental problems.</line>
   <line>Excuse me.</line>
   <line>Come in.</line>
   <line>Something going on
with this family, boss.</line>
   <line>The brother and sister
hate each other.</line>
   <line>She says they've been oil and
water ever since dad died..</line>
   <line>He says it's because she's crazy.</line>
   <line>Plus that door upstairs.</line>
   <line>Do you, uh, trust this Tina?</line>
   <line>She seems more sad than crazy.</line>
   <line>She was hospitalized
twice for depression,</line>
   <line>but that doesn't make her a liar.</line>
   <line>So, follow her leads,
see where it takes you.</line>
   <line>Where do you find Judy Enlight?</line>
   <line>She works at St. Anthony's
Church in Roxborough.</line>
   <line>You better wash up.</line>
   <line>Poor Mitch.</line>
   <line>It was such a disgrace....</line>
   <line>how he ended up.</line>
   <line>The flesh is weak.</line>
   <line>Yes, it is.</line>
   <line>How well did you know Mitch?</line>
   <line>Well, the congregation
here is very tightknit.</line>
   <line>Plus, him on the organ
and you singing solos...</line>
   <line>Did you see Mitch the night he died?</line>
   <line>Unless we had a rehearsal,
I don't see how...</line>
   <line>Judy, I have phone records
that show me two calls</line>
   <line>to the Bayes' home that night.</line>
   <line>Well, I suppose you already know, then.</line>
   <line>I was weak, too.</line>
   <line>So did you meet Mitch
the night he died?</line>
   <line>Just for a few minutes.</line>
   <line>Hi, why don't you park?</line>
   <line>I can't do it anymore.</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>Tina knows.</line>
   <line>I can't my daughter
being ashamed of me.</line>
   <line>Mitch, come on, honey.</line>
   <line>We'll talk about it.</line>
   <line>I gotta stop.</line>
   <line>She's my daughter.</line>
   <line>And that's the last
I saw of Mitch Bayes.</line>
   <line>Are you sure you didn't
follow him, Judy,</line>
   <line>in your anger at him,
for breaking it off like that?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>But you called Mitch again later.</line>
   <line>There were two calls from
your house that night, Judy.</line>
   <line>I didn't call again.</line>
   <line>Could your husband have called him?</line>
   <line>He'd have no rason, too.</line>
   <line>Unless he suspected you two.</line>
   <line>So did Lassing embarrass you in church?</line>
   <line>No, he behaved. And we
met Mitch's girlfriend.</line>
   <line>Oh, yeah?
She's a suspect?</line>
   <line>Her alibi's good, but there
was a jealous husband.</line>
   <line>Vera and Jeffries are
checking him out.</line>
   <line>Mitch's clothes from
the van... no socks.</line>
   <line>Is this criminalist screwing up,</line>
   <line>or were they never
there in the first place?</line>
   <line>You might want to ask
your pal Sherman over there.</line>
   <line>People steal stuff off the
dead bodies all the time.</line>
   <line>People steal Timberlands,
leather jackets.</line>
   <line>They don't steal a guy's
socks and nothing else.</line>
   <line>Fine. You know best, apparently.</line>
   <line>Sherman, it's a simple question.
Were the socks at the scene or not?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>Are you sure?</line>
   <line>I'm pretty sure.</line>
   <line>You're known as a
good detective, Sherman.</line>
   <line>They say you're the best in Fugitives.</line>
   <line>Is that what they say?</line>
   <line>So what was going on in that
you were doing work like a bum?</line>
   <line>Nothing that ain't fixed now.</line>
   <line>to mid ' ....</line>
   <line>I was a drunk.</line>
   <line>I mean bombed full-time.</line>
   <line>So probably I did some damage,</line>
   <line>being sloppy.</line>
   <line>Just.... wasn't in my head.</line>
   <line>Uh-huh.</line>
   <line>You know that, uh, name you
wanted followed up, Henry Walsh?</line>
   <line>The guy whose porn rags
were found in the van?</line>
   <line>Did you auto-track him yet?</line>
   <line>Uh, not yet.</line>
   <line>Good. 'Cause I did.</line>
   <line>Figured I'd save you some time.</line>
   <line>Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line>Let's see, he had a carpet
business in Germantown.</line>
   <line>He died three years ago,</line>
   <line>but I got an address
on the son, Tom Walsh,</line>
   <line>if that'll help.</line>
   <line>It would.</line>
   <line>I don't know who my dad knew or didn't.</line>
   <line>Pretty strange how his porn rags</line>
   <line>ended up in a van with a dead man.</line>
   <line>What am I supposed to do about that?</line>
   <line>How about giving it more
than seconds of thought?</line>
   <line>Bayes... I knew a Ryan
Bayes in high school.</line>
   <line>There you go, Tom.
Were you good friends?</line>
   <line>I guess.</line>
   <line>We played a lot of Dungeons
and Dragons together.</line>
   <line>Just nerds, you know.</line>
   <line>Nerds who looked
at dad's porn together?</line>
   <line>I probably took some
magazines there sometimes.</line>
   <line>You guys ever take
it to another level,</line>
   <line>like, uh, going to hookers?</line>
   <line>Do we really got to go into this?</line>
   <line>I've heard so much worse, Tom.</line>
   <line>I guess we cruised for
prost*tute once in a while,</line>
   <line>just look at them. We'd be terrified
if they actually talked to us.</line>
   <line>Where'd you do that cruising?</line>
   <line>Kensington Avenue.</line>
   <line>You see, Tom,
that's helpful to me.</line>
   <line>Embarrasing to you,
but helpful to me.</line>
   <line>Ring, ring.</line>
   <line>I'll get it, Mom. / Ringing.</line>
   <line>Now is not a good time.
- We had to talk, Ryan.</line>
   <line>Not now. / It's very important.</line>
   <line>Mom, go back to the living room.</line>
   <line>Someone's here.</line>
   <line>Someone's here.
- Did you hear me?</line>
   <line>Go back to the living room.
- Tea, tea, tea.</line>
   <line>Ryan, hey, let's you
and me sit down.</line>
   <line>Come on. You need a minute of
peace. Las will sit with your mom.</line>
   <line>Come on, take a break.</line>
   <line>Isn't there someone
that can help you out?</line>
   <line>A girlfriend?</line>
   <line>I don't have time for that.</line>
   <line>We guess your mom's kind
of your girlfriend, huh?</line>
   <line>She takes a lot of my time,
if that's what you mean.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>I take care of my mom, too.</line>
   <line>She sick in a different
kind of way, but, uh,</line>
   <line>it makes me half crazy sometimes.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Doesn't feel natural.</line>
   <line>It's role reversal.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I mean, Mom's
supposed to take care of you.</line>
   <line>That's what you're
used to. / Yeah.</line>
   <line>Did she take good care of you?</line>
   <line>Yeah, sure.</line>
   <line>She let you meet girls?</line>
   <line>Or did she keep you in</line>
   <line>so you had to look elsewhere
for those interests?</line>
   <line>I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.</line>
   <line>I guess I mean these.</line>
   <line>Those aren't mine.</line>
   <line>Technically they belong
to your friend Tom Walsh.</line>
   <line>Do you remember him?</line>
   <line>Uh-uh.</line>
   <line>No? He's the guy you used to
cruise Kensington Avenue with.</line>
   <line>I don't wanna talk about this anymore.</line>
   <line>Thing is, I need explanations
for all these lies.</line>
   <line>Because it looks bad that you lied</line>
   <line>Judy Enright that night.</line>
   <line>And that you lied to me just now</line>
   <line>Ryan. / I want you to leave.</line>
   <line>And it really looks bad that you were</line>
   <line>so familiar with the strip
where your dad was dumped.</line>
   <line>I got questions that need
answers here, Ryan.</line>
   <line>And without good answers,
you're my number-one suspect.</line>
   <line>My mom and I are not
talking to you anymore.</line>
   <line>You speak for your mom?</line>
   <line>Yeah, I do.
And you know what?</line>
   <line>We want you to drop my dad's case.</line>
   <line>When I'm so close to
the truth? Not a chance.</line>
   <line>Well, that was one hot trail
you set us down, Rush.</line>
   <line>You met Enright?</line>
   <line>You call that guy a suspect?
He's a -pound invalid.</line>
   <line>He's been in a wheelchair
since the Great Flood.</line>
   <line>No chance he stabbed
anybody in the last century.</line>
   <line>Okay, but was he our
second called that night?</line>
   <line>Called Mitch to give him
a piece of his mind</line>
   <line>Talked to the boy instead. / Ryan.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I mean, he probably
traumatized that kid.</line>
   <line>Must have told him times</line>
   <line>what a cheating sinner
his old man was.</line>
   <line>Gives Mama's boy his motive.</line>
   <line>Tina...</line>
   <line>thanks for coming.</line>
   <line>Did you find out anything?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Listen, Tina....</line>
   <line>We think we can put Ryan
at the m*rder scene.</line>
   <line>Ryan?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>This is how you help me...</line>
   <line>Your dad wasn't scumbag after all,
but your brother's a m*rder*r?"</line>
   <line>I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>We used to be really close,</line>
   <line>me and my brother.</line>
   <line>Do you think you could
help us one more time?</line>
   <line>Can you do it for your dad?</line>
   <line>A...a dance.</line>
   <line>We really have to go
to church tomorrow.</line>
   <line>There was a...sleep...
sleep... sleepover....</line>
   <line>and a dance,</line>
   <line>and that.... that's where
the kid's were going...</line>
   <line>Kids were going...</line>
   <line>sleepover...</line>
   <line>That-that was a big... dance...</line>
   <line>I know that part, Charolette.
I'm talking about later.</line>
   <line>I-I-I... I danced,
I danced with Ryan.</line>
   <line>After the dancing, much later.</line>
   <line>Did Ryan fight with Mitch?</line>
   <line>Poor Mitch.</line>
   <line>Poor, poor, poor, poor Mitch.</line>
   <line>After the dancing, did Ryan
do something to him?</line>
   <line>Mitch...Mitch..</line>
   <line>Charolette.
- Mitch, Mitch base...</line>
   <line>Mitch took-took you...</line>
   <line>Mitch took you..</line>
   <line>Mitch took you..to..</line>
   <line>you s... your sleepover... Mitch...</line>
   <line>He took me to the sleepover?</line>
   <line>Mitch took you,
Mitch took you...</line>
   <line>Tin-Tina?</line>
   <line>Tina... / It's okay to tell me, Mom.</line>
   <line>What did Ryan do?</line>
   <line>Mom.. What happened?</line>
   <line>Clothes...</line>
   <line>Clothes? Dad's clothes?</line>
   <line>Ge-Get thos.... get those...</line>
   <line>get tho... get those...</line>
   <line>Get that!</line>
   <line>Put it in! put it in!</line>
   <line>Yes, put the clothes... I'll</line>
   <line>I'll fo...</line>
   <line>I'll follow..</line>
   <line>I'll follow.</line>
   <line>Wait!</line>
   <line>Get that! Get that!</line>
   <line>Get that!</line>
   <line>Get that over there.</line>
   <line>over there!</line>
   <line>Get that over there!</line>
   <line>Get those vials!</line>
   <line>Yes!</line>
   <line>Yes, hurry!</line>
   <line>Put the...put them in?</line>
   <line>Yes.</line>
   <line>Yes! Hurry!</line>
   <line>Hurry!</line>
   <line>Okay, Charlotte.</line>
   <line>Okay.</line>
   <line>You've totally disrupetd my family.</line>
   <line>No, that was you, Ryan.</line>
   <line>You and your mom, years ago.</line>
   <line>We heard all about you staging the scene.</line>
   <line>When you weren't there to charperone,
your mom gave us details.</line>
   <line>You took advantage of
a sick, old woman?</line>
   <line>But you forgot the socks.</line>
   <line>Nice touch with the crack vials,
though... real respectful to dad.</line>
   <line>I respected my dad.</line>
   <line>Really? / I respected
my mom, too.</line>
   <line>What was I supposed to do?</line>
   <line>You trying to blame Mom?</line>
   <line>Mom who treated you
like you walked on water?</line>
   <line>I never asked fot that.
I didn't want to be her pet.</line>
   <line>She chose me.
I couldn't shake her.</line>
   <line>Like you can't shake her now.</line>
   <line>You dreamed of being an adult, right?</line>
   <line>Finally escaping her?
- But then Mom got sick.</line>
   <line>And now you're trapped again.</line>
   <line>You have no idea
how much she needs.</line>
   <line>I know, Ryan.</line>
   <line>That's why you leave
the front door open.</line>
   <line>Maybe she'll wander away for good,</line>
   <line>and then you'll be free.</line>
   <line>I love my mom.</line>
   <line>But you're angry at her
for what she made you do:</line>
   <line>commiting m*rder in her name.</line>
   <line>I didn't do that.</line>
   <line>Come on, Ryan, you're
a classic mama's boy.</line>
   <line>What better way to protect your mom</line>
   <line>than to k*ll the guy
who's done her wrong?</line>
   <line>My mom didn't need
protecting from anyone.</line>
   <line>What's that supposed to mean?</line>
   <line>You only know her
as this feeble woman</line>
   <line>who gets confused and scared,</line>
   <line>and you probably feel bad for her.</line>
   <line>But you didn't see her in her prime...</line>
   <line>when she terrorized us.</line>
   <line>We weren't supposed to talk about it.</line>
   <line>Nice family keeping up appearances.</line>
   <line>She would b*tch me
and Tina out all the time.</line>
   <line>When it got really bad...</line>
   <line>when she was good
and drunk and crazy...</line>
   <line>she would attack my dad.</line>
   <line>Hit him?</line>
   <line>He never hit her back.</line>
   <line>He would just take it.</line>
   <line>and get away as soon as possible.</line>
   <line>Is that why he had all those
locks on his bedroom door?</line>
   <line>He couldn't sleep if he
didn't lock himself in at night.</line>
   <line>That's how scared he was of her.</line>
   <line>And still he stood up
for me that night.</line>
   <line>Knowing what she could do to him.</line>
   <line>Why are you home, Ryan?</line>
   <line>Why aren't you at the dance?</line>
   <line>Mom didn't want me to go.</line>
   <line>We had an interesting call tonight.</line>
   <line>He had a date, Charlotte.</line>
   <line>Well, apparently,
you both had dates.</line>
   <line>All right, get your jacket. I'll
take you to the dance myself.</line>
   <line>No, he's staying with me.</line>
   <line>Look, he's years old, Charlotte.</line>
   <line>He doesn't want to sit home on
a Saturday night with his mother.</line>
   <line>Yes, he does!</line>
   <line>Yes, he does.</line>
   <line>Unlike you, who would rather
be sneaking around with Judy.</line>
   <line>Don't do this in front of Ryan.</line>
   <line>Ryan? Ryan took the call!</line>
   <line>This between you and me,</line>
   <line>and I'm going to take
him over to the dance</line>
   <line>and when I come back,
we can talk about it.</line>
   <line>He's staying with me!</line>
   <line>He loves me.</line>
   <line>He loves me.</line>
   <line>Don't you, Ryan?</line>
   <line>I do.</line>
   <line>But I want to go to the dance.</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>The both of you teaming up against me?</line>
   <line>Ryan, get your jacket now.
- Wha... Ryan....</line>
   <line>I'm not going to talk to you
when you're like this, Charlott.</line>
   <line>Do you understand that?</line>
   <line>Now I'm going to go upstairs and
I'm going to get some dry clothes.</line>
   <line>Mitchell... Mitchell!</line>
   <line>Ryan!</line>
   <line>Mi...</line>
   <line>Ryan...</line>
   <line>Mitchell!
- Mom,</line>
   <line>Mitchell! No!
- mom....</line>
   <line>No!</line>
   <line>Judy Enright is cheap Christmas trash!</line>
   <line>She's a disgrace and you're a
disgrace to good churchgoing people!</line>
   <line>Do not shut me out!</line>
   <line>Don't ....you...</line>
   <line>Don't you shut me out! / Mom!</line>
   <line>Do not shut me out!</line>
   <line>You will not disgrace me!</line>
   <line>Don't you shut me out!</line>
   <line>You will not disgrace me!</line>
   <line>No!</line>
   <line>Ryan...</line>
   <line>Get the van.</line>
