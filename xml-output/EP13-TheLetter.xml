   <line type="dialogue">Whoo!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You a big ten years old today.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Happy birthday, baby girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When my mother passed away a few weeks ago,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I found this letter among
her belongings hidden away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's the last letter that my
grandmother ever wrote to her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When was your grandmother m*rder*d?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her name was Sadie douglas.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Came from Virginia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Moved north to find work in the ' s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know much more than that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your mom didn't talk about her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was only ten years old
when Sadie was k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And she never really forgave
her for what she was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which was what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The police called her a common
two-bit hooker.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My mother referred to her
as a white man's whore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was hard for her, knowing
that that's where she came from.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe it's affected me somewhat, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These letters you have are from ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie wrote one to her every week.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I know I'm asking a lot,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but Sadie mentioned someone,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He best not hurt me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That milkman
best not hurt your mama."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What milkman?
- I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She never referred to him
in her other letters.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Back then, the police said Sadie was</line>
   <line type="dialogue">by a John, but...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think my grandmother knew her k*ller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Homicides,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">assaults, r*pes...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">basically every criminal record
before is filed here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">County even sticks us with
their medical charts, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We need homicides.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right down there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought you said they were filed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were, once.
I mean, what's the point?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doers are probably dust in the wind.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't want to waste any more
of your precious time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or cut into your
web-surfing activities.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">White woman stabbed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Suspect, White male with...
get this,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">slender build and black whiskers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">it's a m*rder ledger, Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Going all the way back to .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">years of m*rder and mayhem.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All in a you-stash-it off the highway.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yo.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I found Sadie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had to put them in plastic.
They were falling apart in our hands.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie douglas.
Colored female.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nativity, Virginia.
Occupation, prost*tute.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Resided at a boarding house
for colored women.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Proprietor was a miss Thea marion.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Women in the boarding
house were all hookers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie was r*ped and suffocated
at the hand of an unknown assailant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe our milkman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A ticket for New York
dated the night of</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the m*rder found
in the victim's belongings.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie's daughter
was living in Virginia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So why is she going to New York?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Last to see her was another tenant
at the boarding house,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">colored female, .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blanche D.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The rest of her name is missing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You find Blanche,
maybe we find out
why Sadie was going to New York.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like the geezer's gonna remember.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and Mr. Sensitivity track
down the milk companies</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that delivered to Sadie's
boarding house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush and Valens'll be on geezer patrol.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks like she fought back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something under her nails?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Back then it didn't matter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It does now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So if the family gives the green light...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">maybe we dig her up?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yep. Go talk to her granddaughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">An exhumation?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that really necessary?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She may have fought her k*ller, Sarah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We might get something useful.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Match the DNA to the doer
or his descendants,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if either's in the system.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll sign whatever papers you need.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Last to see your grandmother alive
was a woman named Blanche.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You recall that name
in any of her letters?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blanche...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie wrote about a fair
she went to with a Blanche.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had my first cotton candy today.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like eating sugar from a cloud...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">First thing you come up,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna get you your own
cotton candy, baby.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll be so happy together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your mama misses
you like dry land for rain.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Love, mama.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She sent that photo with this letter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could I take this and the letters?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will you bring them back?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're all I have left of her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thing's making me seasick.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">At least I got my roll on.
You can't even do yours.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stop.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Damn thing's gonna explode.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good lord.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks like a Baylor's
milk company delivered</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to north th street through the s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where Sadie's boarding house was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Board of revenue's got Baylor's
employee records to .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But nothing for .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So why is that year missing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fire.
January .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Company stopped keeping
records after that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fire must've really wiped them out.
They went out of business a year later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If this fire cost lives, newspapers
would have carried accounts, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So maybe our milkman's in one
of those newspapers?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We sure this place got prostitution
arrests before ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hookers, homicides,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the works.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If Blanche got picked up,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we'll find her here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wonder where she is now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wherever hookers who make
it to end up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's hope it ain't hooker heaven.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Debbins, blanche.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This our girl?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's a dead-ringer for this Blanche.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arrested for prostitution in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Delaney manross paid for her bail.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Manross delaney?
The candy man?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Delaney's delights?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You never had a Delaney delight?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guy's got a candy franchise.
Been raking it in forever.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe our h**ker's moved up
in the world, hmm?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blanche debbins?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ain't used that name in decades.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whaddya you want, honey?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Philadelphia homicide,
miss Blanche.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And the police, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Make me feel young again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Honey! Manross!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm watching my talk show, honey!
- Well turn it off, honey!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got guests.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was the depression, honey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Times were hard all over,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">especially for colored women
coming up alone from the south.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You did what you could
to make ends meet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Today's young people
don't understand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You all help yourself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Try my number nine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He gets on his high horse sometimes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't mind him.
That's what I do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Isn't that right, candy man?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Day she called me candy man,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I fell head over heels.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Been falling for her ever since.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know anything about a trip</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie was taking to New York,
miss Blanche, night she was k*lled?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She told us she was going to bed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not to New York.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, did Sadie ever mention anyone,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">maybe a milkman she was afraid of?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That rebby boy, what's his name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Southern rebel wannabe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wasn't more than northern White Tr*sh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">what was his name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't recall, honey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pierce. That was his name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had burns all over his face.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm telling the story, honey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had burns all over his face.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had it out for Sadie, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All because of that damn milk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ain't getting out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not for no colored whorehouse.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let them get their own damn milk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, here comes another one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She looks almost white, don't she?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come and get it!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who that cooze think she is, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, dump it! / Huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I said dump it, Jonesy!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let her clean it up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie turned and walked
right back into the house</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and left that milk out in the street.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That other milkman wasn't no better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Didn't I say I'm telling the story?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This, uh, Pierce
cause any other trouble?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not that Sadie mentioned.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I avoided him and his milk truck after that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Sadie was afraid he might hurt her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wrote about him
in a letter to her daughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Honey, Sadie couldn't read or write.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">None of us could back then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But she sent letters to her daughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lots of them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, she might have sent them,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but she sure didn't write them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So who wrote Sadie's letters?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No one in the house could read or write.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A John, maybe?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whoever it was might've
known more about the milkman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, if the milkman was this guy Pierce,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">then we might have the answer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Newspaper from .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pierce mcclintock listed as a burn victim
in the Baylor's milk company fire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The same company delivered milk
to Sadie's boarding house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yep. Fire was set by pissed off
white workers</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when the company hired blacks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">including Pierce.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But lucky for us,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">newspapers back then printed
the victims' addresses.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">north th street.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We just got to pray that Pierce
is still there. But yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I'll throw in a hail mary,
we find who wrote this letter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So this is from , huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Interesting.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you can tell from someone's
handwriting who they are?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gender, age, personality type,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">region of origin, pretty much, yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">See these looped letters?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Curved forms combined
with medium pressure</line>
   <line type="dialogue">are usually indicators of femininity.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Writer was female?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Eh, best guess.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kinda K.O.'s our theory
of a John as the writer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So who the hell wrote this letter?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Give me a few hours,
I'll have an answer for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's that tell you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ah. Firm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Logical.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Running from something?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your grandfather, Pierce mcclintock,
owned this house?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He passed away ten years ago.
I inherited the house from him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't understand what he has
to do with this woman's m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We don't know either, miss Reilly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why we're here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was a good man,
my grandfather.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not a m*rder*r.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you'd agree to volunteer your
DNA to prove that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't need to prove that to anyone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can get a search warrant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">An old man's knickknacks?
A dead man's diary?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pierce kept a diary?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After the fire at Baylor's milk,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pierce refers to something
called the fifth day in his diary.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The fifth day?
- Mentioned it a bunch of times.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't you dare put that in your mouth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I like cheez whiz on
my cheesesteak. So what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fifth day sounds like some
sort of group Pierce started.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guys from the milk place
injured in the fire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What'd they do?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doesn't say.
But check that entry out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">May .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pierce's milk bottle w*r with Sadie.
He writes about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thing Blanche told us about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The aftermath...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Delivered to that colored's
boarding house today,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and that flooze just left them
bottles out on the street.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Damn it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She didn't even pick them up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look at that co*n, will you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Standing there like
she runs the joint.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fifth day ought to teach her a lesson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fifth day is right.
Take that gleam outa that quiff's eye.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go on, Jonesy.
You show her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here's your milk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So maybe Jonesy was our
evil milkman and not Pierce.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No Jonesy listed as a victim in the fire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But all them fifth day guys got
messed up in the fire, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So how'd Jonesy get involved with them?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And what's he mean the fifth
day ought to teach her a lesson?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe that's what their little club did,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">teach lessons to women like Sadie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's check criminal records
for Pierce mcclintock.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe his fifth day activities
made the books.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any word on the city okaying
the exhumation?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kite's been in court all day.
- So ask him tonight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've called you three times
about this exhumation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Closing arguments on the wicker job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Besides, you've ignored
a few of my calls lately, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Been busy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well there you go.
We're both busy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyway, we got direction on this job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From ' . / So?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So it's hard to make a case
that the exhumation is pressing,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you know what I mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe the judge should meet
the victim's granddaughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's pressing to her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, Fisk hasn't gotten to it,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I'm guessing you'll need
more probable cause.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The city's strapped for cash.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And this granddaughter
wants answers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't we all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How're the cats, anyway?
- Good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Call me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When you hear from Fisk, I mean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get anything in criminal records?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Long rap sheet on Pierce.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Assaults on males and females,
all black.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Victims claimed they were att*cked
by a group of young white males.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">African american history museum
had a listing of hate groups in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They list the Fifth day as one in Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">White supremacists.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Took their name
from the Fifth day of creation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">God said, let us make man in our image</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and let him rule over all the earth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Meaning the white man, of course.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mission was to terrorize blacks</line>
   <line type="dialogue">coming up from
the south looking for jobs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Every Fifth day,
they'd go on a rampage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Beat up some black person
for the crime of being alive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">m*rder part of their game?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could be.
Check it out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Fifth day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Meet Pierce and our friend Jonesy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jonesy don't look burned.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could have them
where the sun don't shine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Museum didn't have last names
on these clowns.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Id'd them here only by their
monikers or first name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll keep looking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lilly still with the ADA?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Our handwriting expert came back
with a profile of the letter writer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Only child in the boarding house
was the owner's daughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ten years old at the time
of the m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll go pick up Lil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This was miss Sadie's favorite room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My mother took in boarders
during the depression.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hear this place is a bed
and breakfast now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Owners say it was okay
for us to come in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bring you back to your old home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm glad no one tore it down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you write Sadie's letters here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wrote them, yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But the words were hers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her baby girl meant
the whole world to her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you remember writing about
a milkman who might hurt Sadie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jonesy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I remember him well.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because of what Sadie
found in the milk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Show her who's boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here's your milk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing but poor white milkman trash.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who he think he is, trashy ol'...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Poor white milkman trash
left a note, miss Sadie. / Shush, girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's this say?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He says, forgive me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Crazy White Tr*sh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's saying he's sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I still say he trash.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That ain't nothing but tinder for the fire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go on, Arletta.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Throw it in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wait.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Write something for me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why should I?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because you are a lady.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I forgive you them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's your name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My name is Sadie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those notes went on and on
for months,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">right till she died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why did she think
Jonesy would hurt her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think it was her heart, she meant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did they exchange notes
the day she was k*lled?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jonesy wanted her to meet
him here that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For a proper visit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Miss Sadie kept each and every note.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hid them behind the stove
where no one would look,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and no one ever found them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why not?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because I took them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Still have them, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was raised by other people, Sadie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't even know my own folks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jonesy was an orphan?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe check the children's homes
in the area, look for his name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll care for your little girl,
even if she ain't my own,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">because she's like me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Every child deserves to be loved.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He wanted to make a life with her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And take her kid in, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A real from the Fifth day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So was Sadie k*lled by the man who
hated her or the man who loved her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pierce or Jonesy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe something happened that night
at the boarding house</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that turned the tide of Jonesy's love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Love can turn on a dime.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know a candy man?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you love me, Sadie,
or do you love the candy man?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blanche's husband.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blanche and I, we...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">just started dating,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">had a little crush on Sadie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't you do this to me, Manross.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can talk somewhere else,
if that would make it easier.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was young...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">foolish...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">thought I could have my cake
and eat it, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie never went for it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because she was involved with Jonesy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you knew about the affair.
- Not till the night she was k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They hid it well.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You had to, back then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If anyone found out,
one of them would be dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One of them is dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So how'd you find out?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the night of Sadie's m*rder...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were all supposed to
meet up at the juke joint.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought Sadie was going to be
there, but she... she wasn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So I went down to the boarding
house to get her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got to go tonight, Sadie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can't just go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But we talked about this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We was just going to visit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's what you said in your note.
- I know, but...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something came up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you gotta leave with me right now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I already got the tickets,
the train leaves in a half-hour.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We go now and we could
make it, Sadie. / I want to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but why's it gotta be tonight?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's wrong, Jonesy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went back to the juke joint.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never seen her again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie was asking for trouble taking
up with that half-blind white boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you mean, half-blind?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Couldn't see out of one eye,
on account of the fire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why didn't you ever tell anyone
what you saw that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because I didn't want to hurt...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the woman I love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I did, anyway.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Manross volunteered his DNA,
fingerprints, shirt off his back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You really think this guy's the doer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sometimes jealousy beats out
love and hate, hands down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What I don't get is Jonesy was
just gonna visit Sadie that night,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but then something happens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he's frantic to get out of town.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something like what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pierce found out his
white supremacist pal
fell in love with a black woman?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Threatens revenge on them both.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got our milkman.
Nathan jones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just his name, but it's a start.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Grew up in a boys' home in Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ran him through autotrack, DMV,
even military records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got a thousand and one hits back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Manross said Jonesy was injured
in the fire, went half-blind later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If he applied for military duty,
he'd have been rejected, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wait a sec. My old man
went through this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A class F rejection.
Unacceptable for military duty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Made him feel like he had to wear
a dunce cap, back in the day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So we check Nathan jones
with F records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then maybe we finally nail
down this son of a b*tch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi. how'd it go?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Judge Fisk K.O'd
the motion to exhume.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not enough probable cause.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We've got three possible
doers here, Kite.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, it's an ancient case, okay?
And the bottom line is cold cash.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We don't have any to spare.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sarah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi. Any news?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought you might want these.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Notes to Sadie from
the milkman in her letter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She wasn't afraid of him, Sarah,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">she was in love with him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll care for your little girl,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">even if she ain't my own.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He wanted to take care of her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And your mother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wish she had had a chance to
see this, to, to know this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your mom?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have some bad news, too, Sarah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The D.A.'s office didn't
grant the motion to exhume.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I'm the family.
Don't I have a say?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's not that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They need more of a reason to do it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Solving my grandmother's m*rder
isn't a good enough reason?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's complicated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Financially difficult.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll pay for it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sarah...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">An exhumation and autopsy
cost at least $ , .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've memorized all of her letters.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These past few days,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I feel as if I've come as close to
meeting my grandmother
as I ever will.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know how she lived.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I still need to know how she died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Body is in an early stage
of dried mummification.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">soft tissue.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">desiccated down to the bone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are the odds on DNA,
Dr. Barnsley?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is my first year old cadaver.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but DNA can last hundreds of years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She fought back,
broke three fingernails.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe the doer left a souvenir.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The fingers are in advanced
stage of dehydration, but...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I might be able to
collect some scrapings.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're kidding.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jeffries and Vera found Jonesy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's still alive?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And kicking it in New York city.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives, the index finger
of the right hand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think maybe we've got something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe Sadie's speaking
from the grave.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lab's trying Pierce's DNA
from his granddaughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Manross', too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">'s ticket, train to New York.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's going on the cheap.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Taking SEPTA and New Jersey transit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta find Amtrak car way back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">take a free hop when we saw her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kite pissed you off, uh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not fight for the exumation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It wasn't really his decision though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or was it something else with Kite
pissed you off?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gotta be psychic in an answer outta you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I, uh,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">might've made a mistake.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Manross' cleared.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His DNA didn't match to what was
under Sadie's nails.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So candyman ain't our doer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gotta admit it.
Glad for Blanche.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It must be nice to know and get
someone grow old and useless with.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, it must be.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Grandpa?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got visitors.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're here about Sadie douglas,
Mr. Jones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember how she got k*lled?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">r*ped, suffocated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey. What are you saying to him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never mind.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Frankie, why don't you go watch  TV?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't finish your soup, grandpa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm done, Frankie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I remember how she died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cops back then said it was a John.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, no, she wasn't a prost*tute.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She lived in that house
because she had to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Times were rough back then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She didn't make her living hustling?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie was a lady.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gave her some money
from time to time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Of course, she couldn't tell anybody</line>
   <line type="dialogue">where she was getting it from.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Times being what they were.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you being in love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who the hell is Sadie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, her...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">her little girl ought to know
that her mama was a lady.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie's daughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Night of Sadie's m*rder,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you wanted her to leave town with you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because they were coming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were coming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So then, I says to her,
you may look almost white,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but you is black as midnight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jonesy over there don't think I'm funny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, that's because he's giving
her his morning milk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Time that b*tch got a real taste
of white man's milk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ain't that right, Jonesy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Damn right. / Yeah!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fifth day's rolling, boys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tonight!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tonight!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I tried to save her,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I begged her, but she wouldn't go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I left.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A man loves a woman...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and leaves her to that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All this was forever ago.
Why you care now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because a woman died,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and a family wants to know why.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And because what happens
in the past</line>
   <line type="dialogue">never really goes away, does it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. It don't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My grandpa didn't do nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Would you volunteer your DNA
to prove that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got a sister lab here in New York.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It'll take a few minutes
to run your DNA.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And we can go right now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'll do it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right, grandpa?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll get your coat.
He didn't do nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll settle this whole thing
in four or five minutes, Mr. Jones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lab's got a process called, uh,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">electronic DNA sampling.
EDS for short.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Zaps your DNA through the internet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Compares it with what we found
under Sadie's fingernails.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Finds a match.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unless you want to skip the trip
and tell us what really happened?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If you have the question, ask it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thought I just did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, grandpa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm ready.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go ahead and ask your question.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What happened night
Sadie was k*lled?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You gotta leave with me now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I already got the tickets.
Train leaves in half an hour.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We go now, we can make it, Sadie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I want to, but why
it gotta be tonight?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's wrong, Jonesy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The train to New York is...
- New York?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But my daughter lives in Virginia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll send for her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You promised we was gonna be
a family together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We will, but we gotta go now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about her, Jonesy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that's your daughter?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You promised to care for her
like she was your own, remember?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because every child deserve loving,
you said.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">never showed me that before.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why won't you look at her, Jonesy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we can make it together,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">because no one'll know, Sadie.
No one'll know what you are.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You barely look it, Sadie,
and you can pass.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shut up!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She can't pass but you can.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And we can have a life together
and no one'll ever know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shut up!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because I love you, Sadie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I love you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. You don't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just told me so.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, look at what we got here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jonesy's getting a leg
up on us, boys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ain't you, Jonesy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jonesy!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let her be, Jonesy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's wrong with her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get up!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, I said get up!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sadie was a lady.</line>
