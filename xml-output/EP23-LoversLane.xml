   <line>You know that I'll never ever leave you.</line>
   <line>I'll never ever leave you.</line>
   <line>You know the anything me and you hear...</line>
   <line>it's just jealous people talking.</line>
   <line>No one has we have.</line>
   <line>That's why they're jealous.</line>
   <line>Can't wait for Paris until be an adult.</line>
   <line>Can't wait either.</line>
   <line>Wanna get in the car?</line>
   <line>Come on!</line>
   <line>Come on!</line>
   <line>Who's Anna Mayes?</line>
   <line>Don't know.</line>
   <line>Says she knows you from West.</line>
   <line>Oh, her.
She's detective.</line>
   <line>Pain in the a*s.</line>
   <line>She called Lil.
She's bringing us something.</line>
   <line>How are things going at home?</line>
   <line>She went to her sister's.</line>
   <line>Well, that's probably good
that she's, uh,</line>
   <line>during the day, huh? / Mm.</line>
   <line>Scotty Valens, Homicide.</line>
   <line>Hey, Anna.</line>
   <line>The big time looks good on you.</line>
   <line>Anna says all your old CIs
still ask after you.</line>
   <line>Is that right? / They miss the
steak dinners particular.</line>
   <line>This is Lieutenant Stillman.</line>
   <line>Detective Mayes, th District.
- Well, Detective,</line>
   <line>you got an angle on an old one, huh?</line>
   <line>Sam Terrence. Just arrested him
on a loitering complaint.</line>
   <line>Got to talking. Turns out he was just
sprung from Camp Hill after years.</line>
   <line>What did he do?
- Nothing.</line>
   <line>He was convicted of r*pe and m*rder.</line>
   <line>DNA just showed they
pinched the wrong guy.</line>
   <line>Sam, join the party.</line>
   <line>Hi, Sam. John Stillman.</line>
   <line>Hey, I got to be at
the Budget Wash on time.</line>
   <line>I'll get you there.</line>
   <line>These Detectives wanna hear
about the Eve Kendall m*rder.</line>
   <line>Were you in the area, Sam?</line>
   <line>I was collecting cans in the park.</line>
   <line>Middle of the night, I get picked up
and ID'd as a k*ller.</line>
   <line>Who ID'd you?
- Boyfriend of the girl.</line>
   <line>He was also att*cked.</line>
   <line>I did almost two dimes for it.</line>
   <line>I was a young man
when I went in there. Like you.</line>
   <line>This was, uh, ' ?
- Lover's Lane. Teenagers.</line>
   <line>She's r*ped and k*lled,
he's left for dead.</line>
   <line>The least we can do is figure out
whose time you've been doing.</line>
   <line>Eve Kendall, .</line>
   <line>Died from s*ab wounds.
No w*apon recovered.</line>
   <line>Boyfriend Mark Adams was att*cked, too.</line>
   <line>Concussion, shallow wounds.</line>
   <line>Found at Lover's Lane, Fairmount Park.</line>
   <line>Big make-out place in the summertime.</line>
   <line>So you were there a lot.</line>
   <line>How'd Sam become
the whipping boy for this?</line>
   <line>He was half homeless and a boozer.</line>
   <line>Only person in the area
Mark ID'd him from a lineup.</line>
   <line>An ID we now know is bogus.</line>
   <line>That plus the "shallow wounds"
makes me want to talk to Mark again.</line>
   <line>Check it out.</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>Kind of looks like you.</line>
   <line>Sam told the cops about a couple parked</line>
   <line>in a green Datsun a few spaces
away from Mark and Eve that night.</line>
   <line>No follow-up.</line>
   <line>They didn't believe him?</line>
   <line>So maybe that's a job for you.</line>
   <line>What? Tracking green Datsuns from ' ?</line>
   <line>It's glamorous, being in Homicide.</line>
   <line>I know I saw that guy.</line>
   <line>You got knocked out, though, right?</line>
   <line>But I saw him. I'm positive.</line>
   <line>Thing is, an eyewitness being sure</line>
   <line>has no correlation to them being right.</line>
   <line>Sam Terrence is out of jail.</line>
   <line>We're looking at other possibilities now.</line>
   <line>I'll help if I can.</line>
   <line>Remember seeing anyone else
in the park that night?</line>
   <line>It was years ago.</line>
   <line>Maybe another couple parked nearby?</line>
   <line>No. I don't remember that.</line>
   <line>Were you and Eve having
any problem before she died?</line>
   <line>We were completely happy.</line>
   <line>Recent fights...?</line>
   <line>I just said we were completely happy.</line>
   <line>Was she worried about any unwanted attention?</line>
   <line>Eve got all kinds of attention,
but it didn't worry her.</line>
   <line>We'll live in Paris, like expatriates.</line>
   <line>You'll write plays for me.</line>
   <line>And poem.</line>
   <line>And I'll read them out loud at cafes.</line>
   <line>We'll live in a garret.
- What's that?</line>
   <line>It's where artists live.</line>
   <line>With no heat.</line>
   <line>Someone's staring at you.</line>
   <line>Come on.</line>
   <line>Everyone stares,
'cause you're so pretty.</line>
   <line>What do we do for money?</line>
   <line>Nothing. We hate money.</line>
   <line>See you later? / Okay.</line>
   <line>Bye.</line>
   <line>What happened to you being a writer?</line>
   <line>Family business.</line>
   <line>Ever got you upset,</line>
   <line>all that attention she got?</line>
   <line>No. I felt lucky I was her guy.</line>
   <line>Eve was the heartbreak of my life.</line>
   <line>We were gonna be together forever.</line>
   <line>First love?</line>
   <line>It broke me losing her.</line>
   <line>It's weird how much you look like her.</line>
   <line>Wayne Larkin?</line>
   <line>Is it about the trash?</line>
   <line>It's about Eve Kendall.</line>
   <line>She was m*rder*d...
.</line>
   <line>Oh, yeah.</line>
   <line>Trying to watch the program.</line>
   <line>It's the cops, Dad.</line>
   <line>Outside.</line>
   <line>Diabetes and gout.</line>
   <line>So how did you know Eve?</line>
   <line>We both worked at the mall.</line>
   <line>We were sort of weekend friends.</line>
   <line>In our write-up, it says you
saw her the day she died.</line>
   <line>Uh... around : after work.</line>
   <line>Saw her at the bus stop.</line>
   <line>Her boyfriend Mark didn't
pick her up after work?</line>
   <line>Oh, he dropped her off a lot,
but she took the bus home.</line>
   <line>She talk about her boyfriend to you?</line>
   <line>Yeah. I guess he was pretty possessive.</line>
   <line>Really? / Yeah, but I don't think
the feeling was mutual.</line>
   <line>She was still, uh,</line>
   <line>you know, looking around.</line>
   <line>You work till : ?</line>
   <line>Yeah, 'cause after the movie,
I got to sweep up all
the popcorn and leftover junk.</line>
   <line>That's so late.</line>
   <line>You're a Summer.
You should wear baby pink.</line>
   <line>I don't mind.
I like being at work.</line>
   <line>You know, I-I can get you in free.</line>
   <line>Yeah?</line>
   <line>Yeah. Tonight even,
if you want.</line>
   <line>Top g*n. : and : .</line>
   <line>Maybe.</line>
   <line>Remember me?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Peach-banana, well-blended.</line>
   <line>You move pretty good.</line>
   <line>Thanks.</line>
   <line>You sing, too?</line>
   <line>Yeah, I sing.</line>
   <line>So you ever gonna take me up on my offer?</line>
   <line>You mean about - - ?</line>
   <line>Yeah. It's a hot place.</line>
   <line>I don't have I.D.</line>
   <line>I'll get you in.</line>
   <line>Can my friend come?</line>
   <line>Sure.</line>
   <line>How's tonight?</line>
   <line>My mom leaves for work at : .</line>
   <line>So, who was this guy?</line>
   <line>Worked in the music store.</line>
   <line>I guess they met at the food court.</line>
   <line>Do you remember a name?</line>
   <line>You know, I want to say Max, uh...</line>
   <line>but it was a pretty long time ago.</line>
   <line>Mark has this girl up on a pedestal.</line>
   <line>She was everything to him, his one and only.</line>
   <line>But he apparently wasn't hers.</line>
   <line>Sounds like the older dude
took her out at least once.</line>
   <line>Hmm, a week before she bought it.</line>
   <line>So, either Mark was totally in the dark,</line>
   <line>or he knew about the extracurriculars.</line>
   <line>And maybe did something about it.</line>
   <line>Him being possessive.</line>
   <line>Oh, years old, I find out
my girl's stepping out on me?</line>
   <line>That feels like the end of the world.</line>
   <line>Pretty vicious crime for a teenage doer.</line>
   <line>Wouldn't set any records, Lil.</line>
   <line>Must be Eve's mom.</line>
   <line>She was a super nice kid.</line>
   <line>No enemies.</line>
   <line>Any strange behavior from
her those last few weeks?</line>
   <line>Strange behavior was constant.</line>
   <line>One thing was a little off.</line>
   <line>She wanted to borrow $ .</line>
   <line>Wouldn't say why.</line>
   <line>What did you think of
her boyfriend Mark?</line>
   <line>Nice. Especially for a rich kid.</line>
   <line>He treat Eve okay?</line>
   <line>Yes, called about four times a night.</line>
   <line>Like he was checking up on her?</line>
   <line>I just took it as kids in love.</line>
   <line>Did you ever hear of a guy named Max?</line>
   <line>Oh, you bet I did.</line>
   <line>That jerk came to my house!</line>
   <line>Don't forget to call before you go to sleep.</line>
   <line>What?
You tummy hurt?</line>
   <line>No. I don't know.</line>
   <line>Need me to stay home, baby?
- No, Mom, go.</line>
   <line>Uh... Good evening.</line>
   <line>Yes?</line>
   <line>Is Eve here?</line>
   <line>Who are you?</line>
   <line>I'm Max... Tanning.</line>
   <line>Well, turn around Max.</line>
   <line>Mom!</line>
   <line>How old are you?</line>
   <line>Um...</line>
   <line>cause she's !</line>
   <line>Ok, no harm, no foul.</line>
   <line>Walk away.</line>
   <line>Mother!</line>
   <line>You can wait makeup... / Why?</line>
   <line>You don't know how you look to the world!</line>
   <line>What are you talking about?</line>
   <line>Cause you're young.</line>
   <line>But not so young that people
don't see you and think things.</line>
   <line>I can handle it, Mom.
- And want things.</line>
   <line>You don't even understand.
- I can handle it!</line>
   <line>Did Mark know about this guy?</line>
   <line>I don't know.</line>
   <line>There was a lot
I didn't know with Eve.</line>
   <line>She was in that hard teenage stage.</line>
   <line>I'm familiar.</line>
   <line>I was just waiting till
she got... to her twenties.</line>
   <line>We could be friends again.</line>
   <line>Right.</line>
   <line>But we never got there.</line>
   <line>If I'm -year-old girl,</line>
   <line>why do I need $ ?</line>
   <line>And why not get it from
the rich boyfriend?</line>
   <line>Maybe it had something
to do with this older guy.</line>
   <line>You mean some she didn't
want Mark knowing about?</line>
   <line>Her mom said Eve was feeling
queasy that night creepo came over?</line>
   <line>Pregnant?</line>
   <line>Maybe he knocked her up.</line>
   <line>She can't tell her mom
or home-sliced Mark.</line>
   <line>Autopsy didn't show that.</line>
   <line>Well, let's double check.</line>
   <line>Well, that would give motive
to the older guy...</line>
   <line>say she wanted to keep it.</line>
   <line>Or Mark, same motive.</line>
   <line>Let me go back to him.
Solo.</line>
   <line>I'd better zip.
I'll go down with you.</line>
   <line>My boss sends his regards.
Lieutenant Doherty.</line>
   <line>Yeah, we worked the streets together.</line>
   <line>And if you got an extra desk around here,</line>
   <line>he'll recommend me for keeps.</line>
   <line>Subtle, Mayes.</line>
   <line>You two want her to find Creepo?</line>
   <line>So, Eve being pregnant?</line>
   <line>It's impossible.</line>
   <line>How come?</line>
   <line>We hadn't gone all the way yet.</line>
   <line>That garret in Paris,
that was gonna be the place.</line>
   <line>But if there was another
guy in the pictures... / No, no.</line>
   <line>There was, Mark.
Someone named Max.</line>
   <line>There was no other guy.</line>
   <line>Yeah, you don't... didn't know Eve.</line>
   <line>I know what it's like being .</line>
   <line>How flattering it is to have
an older guy giving you attention?</line>
   <line>Eve wouldn't have cheated on me.
- And what if she did?</line>
   <line>What would you have done to her?</line>
   <line>I didn't k*ll her.</line>
   <line>I loved her.</line>
   <line>People k*ll people they love.</line>
   <line>I got att*cked myself,
for God's sake.</line>
   <line>She was m*rder*d.
You had minor wounds.</line>
   <line>Do you have a soul mate?</line>
   <line>Cause if you did,
you would understand Eve and me.</line>
   <line>I understand you were
controlling with her.</line>
   <line>So you've never been in love like that.</line>
   <line>Mark?</line>
   <line>You'll picked them up? / Yeah.</line>
   <line>Five O'clock.</line>
   <line>Uh... we've been having a rocky time.</line>
   <line>She senses the truth.</line>
   <line>Which is?</line>
   <line>That I loved Eve more than anyone.</line>
   <line>Vaguely familiar.</line>
   <line>Worked at the Smoothie Spot.</line>
   <line>You went to her house one night,</line>
   <line>her mom made you for the sleazebag
you were kicked your a*s out.</line>
   <line>Oh, her.</line>
   <line>One of the many youngsters in your past?</line>
   <line>I met her at the food court.</line>
   <line>Struck up a conversation,
and eventually</line>
   <line>I asked her
did she wanna go dancing.</line>
   <line>Is that all you were after,
a dance partner?</line>
   <line>Did I find her attractive?</line>
   <line>Yes.</line>
   <line>Did I know she was ?
No.</line>
   <line>So you made a date with her.</line>
   <line>Hey, let's not make her
the babe in the woods</line>
   <line>and me the Big Bad Wolf here, okay?</line>
   <line>Sounds accurate to me.</line>
   <line>I made an honest mistake.</line>
   <line>Her mom flew in on
the broomstick, I split.</line>
   <line>Hour later, who shows up at the club...</line>
   <line>Max.</line>
   <line>Hi.</line>
   <line>Well, look at that.</line>
   <line>You made it.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>My mom finally left.</line>
   <line>No problems getting in?</line>
   <line>They didn't even ask.</line>
   <line>The world smiles on pretty girls.</line>
   <line>Uh, you remember my friend Carrie.</line>
   <line>How you doing? / Hi.</line>
   <line>Let me ask you something.</line>
   <line>You ever think about making a video?</line>
   <line>What do you mean?</line>
   <line>You've seen MTV, right?</line>
   <line>Cyndi Lauper, Madonna.</line>
   <line>Belinda Carlisle.</line>
   <line>Cause I think you got something.</line>
   <line>Really?</line>
   <line>My store in Atlantic City,</line>
   <line>we have this sound booth.</line>
   <line>We could book some time,
make a demo, see how it go.</line>
   <line>I've never been to Atlantic City.</line>
   <line>I'm going next weekend.
I'm staying with my cousin.</line>
   <line>Think about it.</line>
   <line>Come on, let's dance.</line>
   <line>Danced a few dances,
then I lost her.</line>
   <line>She left with her friend.</line>
   <line>You didn't take her to Atlantic City?</line>
   <line>Nah.</line>
   <line>That was just dumb talk.
- Did she know that?</line>
   <line>Hey, how much did it cost,
renting that sound booth?</line>
   <line>bucks a session.</line>
   <line>The autopsy's conclusive.</line>
   <line>Eve wasn't pregnant. In fact,</line>
   <line>she was probably
a virgin before the r*pe.</line>
   <line>Well, that backs up Mark's claim.</line>
   <line>And, I guess, Max's.
- What's his story?</line>
   <line>Well, he and Eve talked about making
a demo video, price tag, bucks.</line>
   <line>Oh. What kind of video?</line>
   <line>Singing and dancing, 'cause maybe
she was the new Madonna.</line>
   <line>Oh, that'll work on a -year-old.</line>
   <line>Vera found Eve's friend Carrie.</line>
   <line>He's upstairs with her now.</line>
   <line>Well, maybe she knows where Eve
came down on Max versus Mark.</line>
   <line>I remember Max from the music store.</line>
   <line>Him and Eve have something going on?</line>
   <line>She had a boyfriend, Mark.</line>
   <line>We've met him.</line>
   <line>Yeah, she really loved him.</line>
   <line>So why's she sneaking out at night
to go meet Max?</line>
   <line>We were kids, you know.</line>
   <line>Max says he never saw
Eve after that night at - - .</line>
   <line>He didn't mention Atlantic City?</line>
   <line>Said that idea never took off.</line>
   <line>No, they were going.</line>
   <line>It was all she talked
about the next day.</line>
   <line>Thanks, Wayne.</line>
   <line>And don't tell about Atlantic City.</line>
   <line>I don't think it's a good idea, Eve.
I don't trust that Max guy.</line>
   <line>Me, neither.</line>
   <line>Well, he wants me to make a video.</line>
   <line>You know what he really wants.</line>
   <line>Come on. / Personally,
I think he's sleazy.</line>
   <line>Why do you want to do
that to Mark, anyway?</line>
   <line>I'm not doing anything to Mark.</line>
   <line>I think he just wants
to make a move on you.</line>
   <line>Well, I wouldn't let that happen, okay?</line>
   <line>You want to go do something...</line>
   <line>the three of us?</line>
   <line>Well, I'm meeting Mark.</line>
   <line>But you and Carrie should go.</line>
   <line>Her boyfriend's like the
nicest guy in the whole school.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I've seen him.
He brings her to work sometimes.</line>
   <line>I could get us free into the movies.
Top g*n.</line>
   <line>I already saw it.</line>
   <line>Me, too.</line>
   <line>You ever just want to leave?</line>
   <line>Just go away, forever?</line>
   <line>Drive, and drive,
till you get to California?</line>
   <line>Not really.</line>
   <line>Wanna hang out?</line>
   <line>Okay.</line>
   <line>We both told Eve not to go,</line>
   <line>but, well, she kept saying
she could handle it.</line>
   <line>Well, what kind of car
did Wayne drive?</line>
   <line>This beat-up old Datsun.</line>
   <line>Carrie said that Wayne from the mall
drove a green Datsun in ' .</line>
   <line>A ' B- was registered to
a Jim Larkin. Probably his dad.</line>
   <line>The same type of car Sam thought
he saw the night Eve was k*lled.</line>
   <line>Hey.</line>
   <line>Don't look so wonderful,
cops comin' here for me.</line>
   <line>I badged the boss.
Told him what it's about.</line>
   <line>Want you to look at some pictures, Sam.</line>
   <line>That's the guy in the Datsun.</line>
   <line>You sure?</line>
   <line>I mean, I don't wanna say definitely but...</line>
   <line>You think you saw him before.</line>
   <line>That night.</line>
   <line>It's what my mind is telling me,</line>
   <line>but I wouldn't swear to it.</line>
   <line>But your gut reaction is
this kid was there that night.</line>
   <line>With a heavy-looking girl.</line>
   <line>Heavy, huh? / But I couldn't put
my hand on a Bible and say it.</line>
   <line>I better jump back in here.</line>
   <line>An eyewitnesses puts you
at the scene, Wayne.</line>
   <line>What do you mean?
- Lover's Lane.</line>
   <line>You were there that night...</line>
   <line>in your Datsun with a girl.</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>A big girl.
Like Carrie.</line>
   <line>That's crazy.</line>
   <line>See, I think you had it bad for Eve.</line>
   <line>But you didn't have a shot there,</line>
   <line>That's common enough.</line>
   <line>I gotta be at the airport.
- So, you go parking with Carrie.</line>
   <line>But she's not really rocking your world.</line>
   <line>After a few Tall Boys,
you're feeling pretty loose.</line>
   <line>And there's Eve with Mark
just a few spaces over,</line>
   <line>to Wayne Larkin.</line>
   <line>I was never at Lover's Lane with Carrie.</line>
   <line>You can polygraph me.</line>
   <line>You hung out with her the weekend before.</line>
   <line>Carrie told us.</line>
   <line>We watched  TV.</line>
   <line>I didn't dig her,
she didn't dig me.</line>
   <line>It was a nonevent.</line>
   <line>Were you pissed off about Eve
going to Atlantic City, Wayne?</line>
   <line>I thought it was a bad idea,
but it was her life.</line>
   <line>So you didn't try to stop her?
- I helped her.</line>
   <line>She borrowed bucks,
so she could run off
with that statutory r*pist.</line>
   <line>You loaned Eve the money?</line>
   <line>And that guy Max was so sleazy,</line>
   <line>he wouldn't give it
back to me after she died.</line>
   <line>There was no trip to Atlantic City.</line>
   <line>Yeah, but there was supposed to be.</line>
   <line>Eve even gave you the money.</line>
   <line>She was a kid.
- That wasn't stopping you.</line>
   <line>You had it all set up
for a Saturday night score in A.C.</line>
   <line>I'm telling you, she was a kid.</line>
   <line>You liked kids.</line>
   <line>That's why you hung out at - - .</line>
   <line>Too bad that joint got shut
down for serving to minors.</line>
   <line>Where do you hang out now,
high schools?</line>
   <line>I didn't do anything to that girl.</line>
   <line>I'm the one who called it off.</line>
   <line>You ready?</line>
   <line>I'm ready.</line>
   <line>What's the sleeping bag for?</line>
   <line>Well, we're staying over, right?</line>
   <line>Yeah, you're not gonna need that.</line>
   <line>Is there a guest room?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>Then...</line>
   <line>where am I sleeping?</line>
   <line>Eve, we're going on a trip here.</line>
   <line>Together.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I know.</line>
   <line>Okay, you a grown-up or not?</line>
   <line>Cause if not, you should stay here.</line>
   <line>Go have hot fudge sundaes with
your girlfriend, you know. Play dolls.</line>
   <line>You wanna go with me,
you gotta be an adult.</line>
   <line>So you tell me.</line>
   <line>You a kid?</line>
   <line>Or are you a grown-up?</line>
   <line>I guess I'm gonna need
my bucks back.</line>
   <line>The money's already spent.</line>
   <line>But...</line>
   <line>It's spent.</line>
   <line>Didn't get the booty you wanted,
figured you were owed something?</line>
   <line>Sounds more like pretty
theft than calling it off.</line>
   <line>The point is, we didn't
go anywhere that day.</line>
   <line>And that was the last I ever saw her.</line>
   <line>So the D.A.'s really enjoying</line>
   <line>blowing the Kendall case.</line>
   <line>That's his problem.</line>
   <line>Yeah, and mine,</line>
   <line>if he ships me off to Welfare Fraud.</line>
   <line>For what?</line>
   <line>For associating with the troublemaker.</line>
   <line>What, your dealer?</line>
   <line>Hi.</line>
   <line>Hi. / I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>I just needed to...</line>
   <line>I looked you up.</line>
   <line>I-I keep thinking about her.</line>
   <line>I'll just be five minutes.</line>
   <line>She'd hate who I am now.</line>
   <line>Workaday.</line>
   <line>Bourgeois.</line>
   <line>Practical.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>But we wanted...
we wanted exciting lives.</line>
   <line>Like yours.</line>
   <line>Oh, it's, uh, not so exciting. / No?</line>
   <line>No. It's more like I watch other
people's lives from a front row seat.</line>
   <line>Are you who you thought you'd be?</line>
   <line>I mean, when you were ?</line>
   <line>No. No, I...</line>
   <line>I had a whole other plan for
what I wanted.</line>
   <line>And?</line>
   <line>It was impossible.</line>
   <line>Well, I'm glad you came along.</line>
   <line>I mean, I feel... I feel awake again.</line>
   <line>You've been living a life...</line>
   <line>No...</line>
   <line>I've been going through paces.</line>
   <line>Like it was all forgotten,
buried away with her, but</line>
   <line>now...</line>
   <line>I remember everything.
- Floods back, huh?</line>
   <line>Like it was yesterday.</line>
   <line>I still love her.</line>
   <line>Mark...</line>
   <line>Wendy knows and I-I...</line>
   <line>I couldn't stay there tonight.</line>
   <line>I just, I just wanted to be with...</line>
   <line>with her.</line>
   <line>And I found myself coming to you.</line>
   <line>Oh, crap.
It's... it's : .</line>
   <line>Yeah, I'm gonna go.</line>
   <line>I.I lost... I lost track of time.
- Well, you're busy.</line>
   <line>You're busy, so I'll see you
tomorrow. / Kite...</line>
   <line>I'll see you tomorrow.</line>
   <line>We got a new theory, Carrie.</line>
   <line>You and Wayne.</line>
   <line>Me and Wayne, what?</line>
   <line>You were both nursing
some hard feelings towards Eve.</line>
   <line>Him 'cause he was so hung up on her,</line>
   <line>and you 'cause she got all that attention.</line>
   <line>Maybe you too got tired of her
being the queen bee all the time.</line>
   <line>Started talking revenge.</line>
   <line>I didn't talk to Wayne about anything.</line>
   <line>I know what it's like being
the fat kid in high school, Carrie.</line>
   <line>It's a misery.</line>
   <line>It's not great.</line>
   <line>Changing for gym class
in front of everybody.</line>
   <line>Going to pool parties
and wearing your shirt the whole time.</line>
   <line>Girls like Eve prancing around
in bikinis, getting ogled.</line>
   <line>Always their friend,
never the girlfriend, right?</line>
   <line>That could lead to some dark thoughts.</line>
   <line>Maybe Wayne did something...
but not me.</line>
   <line>His car was seen at Lover's Lane,
night of the m*rder.</line>
   <line>Two people inside.</line>
   <line>We were thinking it was you with him.</line>
   <line>You must be joking.</line>
   <line>I hated Wayne.</line>
   <line>Oh, what was to hate?</line>
   <line>I love this part when the pizza
comes to Mr. Hen's class.</line>
   <line>Yeah, it's funny.</line>
   <line>Oh, Dad, I thought you were asleep.</line>
   <line>How's it going?</line>
   <line>Good.</line>
   <line>You seen this before.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Come in here.</line>
   <line>I got something better on.</line>
   <line>I don't know.
- Brings the beers with you.</line>
   <line>No big deal.</line>
   <line>Are you coming?</line>
   <line>I really wanna watch this.</line>
   <line>Can't you ever bring a good one?</line>
   <line>What happened in the bedroom?</line>
   <line>What do you think?</line>
   <line>And you didn't report it?</line>
   <line>Mom, could we call the cops?</line>
   <line>Cause I got drunk with some guy,</line>
   <line>and then his dad said
to come into his room..."</line>
   <line>Right.</line>
   <line>And there's the humiliation factor.</line>
   <line>After he finished,</line>
   <line>he told me to get my giant a*s out.</line>
   <line>You bring girls home to your dad
as a regular thing, Wayne?</line>
   <line>We've been talking to Carrie Plummer again.</line>
   <line>I should be working.
- Forget work.</line>
   <line>He made me.</line>
   <line>Made you what?</line>
   <line>Get girls. / You were , Wayne.
That's an adult.</line>
   <line>He terrorized me my whole life.
He still does.</line>
   <line>You still go strolling for girls,
bring 'em home to dad?</line>
   <line>No. That stopped.</line>
   <line>When?</line>
   <line>After Eve.</line>
   <line>You brought Eve home?</line>
   <line>My dad's gonna k*ll me.</line>
   <line>Come on, Wayne.</line>
   <line>The right thing is to tell.</line>
   <line>Win or lose, I should tell.</line>
   <line>That day, when I saw her
at the bus stop.</line>
   <line>Thought you left already.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>What about Atlantic City?</line>
   <line>I didn't go.</line>
   <line>So you're not gonna make that video?</line>
   <line>I gotta make it up to Mark.</line>
   <line>Do I tell him and ask to be forgiven?</line>
   <line>Or do I never let him know
how stupid I was?</line>
   <line>Don't ask me.</line>
   <line>Could you give me a ride, Wayne?</line>
   <line>I gotta be home.
My dad's medication time is soon.</line>
   <line>Okay, I'll go with you
and then you can drop me off.</line>
   <line>I have to change to meet Mark.</line>
   <line>It's probably not a good idea.</line>
   <line>Why not?</line>
   <line>How about we go away?</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>Drive and drive, as far away as
we can go towards California.</line>
   <line>What are you talking about, Wayne?</line>
   <line>Taking you to California.</line>
   <line>Wouldn't you like that?</line>
   <line>Cause I would.
I would love that.</line>
   <line>That's crazy.</line>
   <line>Yeah, 'course it is.</line>
   <line>Hop in.</line>
   <line>After Carrie,
Dad wanted a good one.</line>
   <line>So you brought him Eve.</line>
   <line>Usually I could only get
girls from the theater to come back.</line>
   <line>Girls I let in for free, you know?</line>
   <line>They were mostly homely and all.</line>
   <line>But dad got real excitied
when he saw Eve.</line>
   <line>And he did to her what he did to Carrie.</line>
   <line>He tried.</line>
   <line>She called him names,</line>
   <line>ran out of there,
said she would tell the cops.</line>
   <line>And that got him mad like I never seen.</line>
   <line>So what did he do about it?</line>
   <line>I can't say any more.</line>
   <line>He'd k*ll me.
I don't wanna talk anymore.</line>
   <line>Remember that fat girl,
Sam thought he saw with Wayne?</line>
   <line>We think it was actually Pops Larkin.</line>
   <line>The guy is Jabba the Hut with a mullet.</line>
   <line>From the back, at night...</line>
   <line>And you think they were targeting the Eve?</line>
   <line>Wayne brought her home earlier that day.</line>
   <line>Jabba tried to grope her,
she didn't go for it.</line>
   <line>Sassed him pretty good.
Said she'd rat him out.</line>
   <line>So he and Wayne went driving
that night, found Eve and Mark.</line>
   <line>Where is this Jabba?</line>
   <line>Drunk in front of the tube probably.</line>
   <line>He don't leave the hut.</line>
   <line>He does now.</line>
   <line>You guys go ahead.</line>
   <line>So, thanks and sorry about the...</line>
   <line>That's okay.</line>
   <line>I've made a mess of my marriage,
and your situation.</line>
   <line>I said it's okay.</line>
   <line>And I don't know what I'm going to do.</line>
   <line>Cause this-this Eve thing...</line>
   <line>Mark, she was as sweet as
you remember.</line>
   <line>But she was mixed up, too.</line>
   <line>Like any -year-old.</line>
   <line>You're talking about that older guy.</line>
   <line>I'm just saying even if she had lived,</line>
   <line>you still might not have
the life you talked about.</line>
   <line>Cause you were kids
when you dreamed it up.</line>
   <line>Maybe.</line>
   <line>Or maybe...</line>
   <line>maybe she was the best thing
that ever came my way,</line>
   <line>and nothing that good is possible.</line>
   <line>Now, let's say that's true.</line>
   <line>But you are here.</line>
   <line>She's not.</line>
   <line>No. But...</line>
   <line>I'm not her.</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>I gotta be someplace.</line>
   <line>I'm really sorry.</line>
   <line>Yeah, yeah, me, too.</line>
   <line>What happened with that guy?</line>
   <line>Oh, he left.
Five minutes after you did.</line>
   <line>You got a funny definition of five minutes.</line>
   <line>It was work, Kite. / Really?</line>
   <line>Was he, was he, um. confession?</line>
   <line>You know how the job is.</line>
   <line>Yeah, the job.</line>
   <line>The job.</line>
   <line>That's always going to be the thing.</line>
   <line>What does that mean?</line>
   <line>We all got jobs.</line>
   <line>We don't all put them ahead of
every other things in our lives.</line>
   <line>Look, this guy left his wife.</line>
   <line>And came to you.</line>
   <line>And there you were.</line>
   <line>He was in a crisis. / Look, Lilly.</line>
   <line>You want save people at :
in the morning, great.</line>
   <line>God bless.</line>
   <line>I know I screwed up.</line>
   <line>It's just who you are, you know,</line>
   <line>and-and I admire it.</line>
   <line>I do.</line>
   <line>But, uh,</line>
   <line>I don't wanna live like that.</line>
   <line>I'll see you, okay?</line>
   <line>Wayne's in trouble?</line>
   <line>You're both in trouble.</line>
   <line>What did I do?</line>
   <line>I don't leave my place,
I got the gout.</line>
   <line>This dates back to when you
did leave, once in a while.</line>
   <line>August, ' .
Lover's Lane.</line>
   <line>I don't know what you're talking about.</line>
   <line>The r*pe and m*rder of Eve Kendall.</line>
   <line>Your boy's been talking.</line>
   <line>Wayne is a liar.</line>
   <line>Carrie Pummer's been talking, too.</line>
   <line>About you raping her when she was .</line>
   <line>A lot of girls been around here.</line>
   <line>Anything that happened was voluntary.</line>
   <line>Really? / They were cows.</line>
   <line>Should'be thanked me.</line>
   <line>Who else was gonna give it to 'em?</line>
   <line>You got personality plus there, Jimbo?</line>
   <line>Lay of the land, Jim.</line>
   <line>We got sperm from whoever
r*ped and k*lled Eve.</line>
   <line>We got three bags of your
beer bottles in the hall out there.</line>
   <line>We compare DNA from your saliva
on them bottles to the spunk?</line>
   <line>End of you being free to sit
your fat a*s on that couch all day.</line>
   <line>Where the hell is Wayne?
- Locked up.</line>
   <line>I'm gonna k*ll that stupid kid.</line>
   <line>Might as well give it up, Jim
Curtain's falling.</line>
   <line>They both should have died.</line>
   <line>But Wayne, he was so weak.</line>
   <line>He couldn't pull off his part.</line>
   <line>Call me disgusting?</line>
   <line>I'll show her disgusting.</line>
   <line>Let's just go home, Dad. / Oh, no.</line>
   <line>Girls thinks so much of herself.</line>
   <line>We're gonna pull her down off
her high horse.</line>
   <line>Then we're gonna give it to her good.</line>
   <line>Can't you just forget it?</line>
   <line>I'll meet another girl...</line>
   <line>No, no, we're getting this one.</line>
   <line>Here.</line>
   <line>Take care of the kid.</line>
   <line>What the hell?</line>
   <line>Remember us,

   <line>Wayne?
- k*ll the kid, Wayne.</line>
   <line>Wayne, what are you doing?
- Take the bottle and k*ll him.</line>
   <line>Come on, Dad... / Shut up!</line>

Deal with him.</line>
