   <line type="dialogue">contest South Philly's ever seen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So get those platforms polished
'cause it's gonna be far out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Bell's giving one
thousand bucks to the winner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You heard me.
One thousand big ones!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Outta sight!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gas and Power guys
were fixing a leak,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">found partial remains
about six feet down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In an old disco?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was an old disco, The Bell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Off Lansing Boulevard, real eyesore?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's the spot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">people were k*lled
there in a fire, .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ruled as arson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">rd was presumed dead,
remains were never found.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You thinking this must be the guy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">John Doe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's all that's left of him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Skull's all I need to get an ID.
Man had excellent teeth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If he burned up in the fire, why
didn't we find him back then?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, apprently he was deep
underground where the VIP room was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Plus, what is that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Slug's been rolling
around in his brain pan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right between the eyes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">sh**t must have been close up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can we get rifling off this slug?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My guess is it's a . .
Should have distinct markings.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This guy was probably shot
before the fire ever got to him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, maybe our doer started
the blaze, covered his tracks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hide one m*rder, cause others.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We don't got a cold one here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got of them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dental records were conclusive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is our John Doe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benjamin Issac Rosen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Twenty-two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I remember the news
coverage of The Bell fire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cryin' families, burned bodies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bulldozers come in quick,
demolish the place?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. What was left standing
was considered a safety hazard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So maybe they did a rush
job finding all the remains.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Explains why they didn't find him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You, uh, ever hang out
at this disco, boss?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, not me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I think Jeffries was a beat
cop in South at the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wonder what he did Saturday nights.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Bell wasn't just a disco,
it was the disco.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lines around the block to get in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lot of feathered hair,
gold chains, polyester...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds like you got
some familiarity there, Will.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was there once.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">William Disco Jeffries.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, Will, bust a move for us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, do the hustle, baby.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, if it's all the
same, I'd rather not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those were regrettable times.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The arson report says the
blaze started in the White Room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know what that was?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">VIP lounge, where all the
cocaine was snorted.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And where's Ben Rosen's
remains were found.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, maybe he started the fire.
- Right after he got shot in the face.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a point.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So who was with Ben
in the White Room?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Chief suspect in the arson
was the owner of the place.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Neil Chaney.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Torched his own club
for the insurance?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'd think he'd wait
till after hours.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks like they dug, but
didn't get far with that theory.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got partial rifling
on the b*llet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a . . / Good
enough to find a match?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yep. We find the g*n
that matches this slug,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">could lead us to the doer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd call that new direction.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vera, Disco Will, have a
conversation with Neil Chaney.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Meantime...
- We'll go to the Rosens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You found Benny,
after all these years?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I always hoped, prayed, he got
out of that conflagration somehow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ran away or something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Foolish. I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny lived at home with you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was going to go to dental school.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Top of his class.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Smart. Sweet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He have any enemies you know of?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought he died in the fire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm afraid he was m*rder*d,
Mrs. Rogen, before the fire started.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">m*rder*d?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was he in any kind of trouble?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How should we know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny was an open book before he
started playing that so-called music.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After, he shut us out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He knew we disapproved.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why shouldn't I have disapproved?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That disco ruined his life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We, uh, kept some of
his things in his room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe you'd like to see?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Salutatorian of
his high school class.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Adorable, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There something you
wanna tell us, Myra?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something you didn't want
your husband to hear?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, of course not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause I got the feeling there was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know this is difficult.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doesn't have to leave this room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There was something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's something I never told my husband.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I came home from temple early
one night, on account of my arthritis.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This was a week before the fire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw them together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My Benny, and a shiksa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mmm, not here, baby. / Come on.
My folks won't be back for hours.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But if we want to win this
competition, we got to practice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't got the rhythm like you do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got it where it counts, baby.
You're far out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When you gonna tell your
parents we're engaged?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Soon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You are such a foxy mama.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, you know I wanna marry you,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">spend my whole life
dancing with you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We don't have to make it
now if you don't want to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll practice,
then we'll make it, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I love you, hot stuff.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were in love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">At least my Benny had
that before he died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Benny ever talk about
his wedding plans?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was probably afraid to.
His father would have hit the roof.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know what happened
to this girl, Sonya?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She got burned in the fire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I visited her once
at Saint Ignatius,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never knew I was there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And your husband still
doesn't know about her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He needs more heartache?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's bad enough feeling his son
betrayed him over disco.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sonya Witkowski?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives Rush and Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're here about Benjamin Rosen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll be right back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I lost Benny in The Bell fire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Part of his remains were
recently found, Sonya.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It appears he was k*lled
before the fire started.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone k*lled him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm afraid so.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We understand you two were engaged.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were gonna get married
after the dance competition.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was such a long time ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was there anything unusual going on
in Benny's life, right around then?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fights? A threat?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. I mean...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You sure he was m*rder*d?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anything you can tell
us could really help.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A couple of days before
the dance contest,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got there early to practice...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, foxy mama, let's hustle.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did Chaney want?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Didn't look like nothing.
- Are we talking or are we dancing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You deal blow for Chaney,
Benny, I'll dump your a*s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not dealin' blow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I swear.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wouldn't lie to me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd rather die.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, after we win that
thousand bucks, baby,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll go to the Manhattan,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">get married at Studio .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta win first.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll win. You're the best
disco dancer in Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Philly? Is that all?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In America. The whole world.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was the love of my life,
you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The real deal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What were Benny and
Mr. Chaney fighting about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny used to give private dance
lessons to some of Chaney's clients,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but it seemed like
something more serious.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you sure it ain't possible
Benny was dealing for him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He said he wasn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">On the off chance that he was, Sonya,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you think Chaney was the kind of
man who could m*rder someone?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know he had a g*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Used to show it off,
like some kind of big shot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're still looking for Neil Chaney,
but he did have a permit for a . .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which he fired in ' .
Shot a burglar at The Bell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A year before Benny was shot.
- File's coming over from South.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We find the slug
he shot at the burglar,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">match it to the one
we got on this job...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Makes Chaney a good bet for the doer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're talking about finding a b*llet
fired years ago from a g*n</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we don't even know exists anymore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Registered to a man we can't find.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The word "longshot" comes to mind.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We like a challenge.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you got one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">File from South IDs this guy
Chaney shot as Mark Rigley.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tried to rob a disco at closing.
Chaney popped him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">sh**ting was ruled self-defense.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe Rigley knows what
happened to the slug.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He doin' time someplace?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh-uh. Custodial detail at
the River Rink, Penn's Landing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Know how we been having
trouble findin' Chaney?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's 'cause County's six months
behind processing death certificates.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Chaney's dead?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three months ago.
Cirrhosis of the liver.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Crap.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what?
We still have unsolved murders.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can't talk to the father,
we'll settle for the son.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's not dead, is he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. Paul Chaney owns
a shop in Center City.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Out on the street, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Excuse me just one second.
Enjoy yourselves.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whassup, folks?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You want a pipe?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Depends what's in it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tobacco, the new marijuana.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's far out, Paul.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tobacco's legal, remember?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, you wanna check
the pipes, be my guest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We ain't narcs.
- We're homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Homicide?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you want with me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your father.
He had a permit for a . .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We thought you might know
where that g*n is now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, excuse me. You mind just
stepping over here for a second?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why? What's this about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Bell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A man was k*lled there that
night before the fire broke out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you want to pin it on my old
man who's trying to rest in peace?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're trying to solve a m*rder.
- Don't you mean murders?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I been through this a hundred times.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everybody blamed my dad for it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why he drank himself to death.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't think he was responsible?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My father loved The Bell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The idea of his torching
it is just craziness.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what about that . , Paul?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I threw it into the Delaware,
like, a decade ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was worried my dad was
going to turn it on himself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember a guy
named Benny Rosen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, yeah, sure.
Benny the Rose.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everybody knew him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone k*lled him that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shot him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, come on.
It wasn't my dad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was by his side the whole
night, at the judge's table.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who else at that disco
had it in for Benny?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny was king.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">People worshipped him.
'Specially the women.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The guy was a real Don Juan stein.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He caught up in any
romantic triangles?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, ha got a serious girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you know, them two
had a fight that day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now I know about this 'cause I was
doing something you might think unsavory,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but try to remember, I was
just a horny kid at the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, yeah,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">do it for me, foxy fox.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is the ladies room, Benny.
Get the hell out! / Sonya, don't cry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're a jerk, you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm just having second thoughts
about eloping. / Yeah, yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's putting too much
pressure on winning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't want it to effect our dancing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't wanna elope 'cause
you're afraid to marry a shiksa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That ain't true.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought you said you'd rather did than
lie to me? / You know how my father is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's , for God's sake.
We can do what we want.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know, but he'd k*ll me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, waiting is k*lling me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you got a choice to make.
It's either him or me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I should k*ll you,
making a sl*t out of me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was a virgin before I met you!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, men, what an idiot that guy was.
Turning away a piece of a*s like that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Believe me, I wouldn't have.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I believe you, Paul.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mark Rigley?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's askin'?
- Philly P.D.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your parole officer said
we might find you here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My crummy boss telling lies again?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is about him and that
borrowed car incident, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was two months ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was an emergency.
- No, it's not about that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just walkin' the straight
and narrow here, man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pushing a broom for minimun wage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mark, in you were
shot at The Bell disco?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. So?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were kinda hoping that you kept that
slug maybe as a suvenior or something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're trying to match it to
a b*llet on another case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You bet I know where that slug is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right here.
For years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sets off metal detectors like crazy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The docs couldn't take it out?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not back then.
Maybe now, modern medicine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'd be willing to give it a go?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm civic-minded.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's nothing I wouldn't
do to assist Philly's finest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Course, Philly's finest gotta assist me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Assist how?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How much you think it's
worth going under the knife?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A couple grand?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's mighty civic-minded of you, Mark.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Capitalism made this
country great, my friend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That two grand?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That ain't gonna happen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then no deal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You guys wanna buy my a*s
b*llet, you know where I work.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You lied to us, Sonya.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lied?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You said you and Benny
were gettin' married,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but you broke up with him that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In the ladies room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we would have worked it out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I should k*ll you,
makin' a sl*t outta me."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two hours later, Benny ends
up with a b*llet in his head.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny was the love of my life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do you know what I said, anyway?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where were you when
the fire started, Sonya?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">On the floor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was Doreen blabbin', wasn't it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That nosy b*tch knew
everything 'bout everything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's Doreen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doreen Di Nova.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had a real thing for Benny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Always trying to steal him for me.
- That right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was competitive
with me over everything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny, dancing, you name it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She in the dance contest that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Her and her partner Ken
were our main competition.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She would have done anything to win.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Last chance for a practice dance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One hour till starting time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You heard of me, baby, one hour.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, my heels.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's okay.
I got another pair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, Benny.
Dance with me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. I got a partner.
- It's not too late to switch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We won last year. We
could do it again this year.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm with Sonya now, Doreen.
- I'm better than her.¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That don't matter.
I love Sonya.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I love Kenny.
But you and me, we could go places,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Manhattan and the like.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get it outta your head.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's not gonna happen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, Doreen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got your headlights on, I see.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why you got to be so selfish, Sonya?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You already got Benny in the sack.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why can't I have him
on the dance floor?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why should I?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause you can't keep
up with him and I can.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ain't heard no complaints.
- I ain't made any.¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fine, be that way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're not gonna be
the king forever, Benny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A lot could happen between
now and the contest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What is that supposed to mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It means I'm going
home wearing that tiara.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Problem, baby?
- No, there's no problem here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, hot stuff.
You're too foxy to fight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Polack.
- sl*t.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A lot could happen between
now and the contest."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And that's a quote.
- You think it was a threat?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just know she was dying to be
dancing queen two years running.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doreen Di Nova?
- Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We need to talk to you
about Benny Rosen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny the Rose? Ooh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a blast from the past.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember threatening him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gloria, hang on a second.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I need a smoke.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You been talking to
Sonya, huh? Right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She a fatty now or what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You make good on that threat, Doreen?
- 'Cause Benny was m*rder*d that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, yeah? Well, that's news to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where were you when the fire started?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">On the floor, with my partner Ken.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What, did Sonya tell you I whacked Benny?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You denying you made a threat?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I might have said
something as a psychout.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To win the contest?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. A thousand bucks was
like a million to us back then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Ken needed that money, bad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why's that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is ancient history, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't get in trouble for
breakin' any narcotics laws?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, back then, coke
was the drug of choice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, Hoover, save a bump for me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't worry, baby, I got more.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Damn!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You snorted it all?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Crap!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm in trouble, baby.
Real trouble.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was supposed to deal that all that blow.
I'm into Chaney for thousands.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you should have thought of that
before you snorted up all his merchandise.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm screwed.
Chaney's gonna k*ll me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You guys got the studio upstairs reserved?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, if you ain't gonna use it,
I thought maybe I'd get in some practicing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're gonna use it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doreen, that stuff throws off
your timing, makes you sloppy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I were you, I'd be worried
about Sonya's two left hoofs</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and not my timing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You used to be good... dedicated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How come you don't practice
no more like you used to?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you care, Bagleboy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're still gonna wipe the
floor with you and Sonya.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess I should've realized
Ken was an addict, but...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">at the time everybody was snorting
like there was no tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You still in contact with Ken?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah. Fire busted us all apart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Burning of The Bell was the
day disco died in South Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was Ken an anti-Semite
along with being an addict?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Instead of Benny the Rose,
he called him Benny the Nose, so...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, Ken could have done
something to Benny that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe to knock him out of the contest,
win that grand to pay off his coke debt?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Though Sonya says you were the
one who was so desperate to win.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that figures.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, me and the Polish American
Princess weren't exactly soul sisters.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I wasn't a coke fiend like Ken,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I wasn't into Chaney
for thousands of dollars.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The b*llet's still in him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Says it's a pain in his a*s, literally.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'll only cooperate for a price.
- What price?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Neighborhood of two grand.
- We don't live in that neighborhood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can't we compel him to
give us the b*llet?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get a search warrant?
- Check with the lawyers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doreen's partner, Ken Mazzacone,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">served a stint at Camp Hill
in ' for dealing coke.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Went straight, got a license
with the city, drives a cab now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Want to go see him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where are you with Doreen and Sonya?
- Both got motive, both got alibis.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They say they were on the dance
floor when the fire broke out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Witness statements
from ' back that up?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I'm on it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You two, see if you can
find this cab dirver.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lil, go visit ADA Kite</line>
   <line type="dialogue">warrant for Mr. Rigley's backside.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gotta take the first hack in line.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're the hack we want, Ken.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do us a favor, step on out of there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember "Benny the Nose", Ken?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From The Bell?
Yeah, I remember Benny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Turns out he was m*rder*d
before the fire broke out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a shame.
- Ain't it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's it got to do with me?
- We heard you didn't like him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That a crime? He was uppity.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause he was a jew?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause he was a drag.
A real Goody Two-shoes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wouldn't deal coke for Chaney, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Relax. This isn't drug bust.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Chaney didn't like a lot
of people telling him no.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He liked you, though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, I ain't denying I
made a little extra cash,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">selling merchandise for Mr. Chaney.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Except you used more than you sold.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ended up owing Chaney a lot of moeny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Heard you had a real love affair
going with the nose candy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, well, I'm off of that particular
diet plan now, as you can see.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thousand bucks, though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go a long way to paying off your debt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All you had to do was
eliminate the competition.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've eliminated nobody.
Didn't need to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was just as good a
dancer as Benny was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We heard Benny was the king.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then you heard wrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where were you when
the fire broke out, Ken?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was on the floor,
warming up with Doreen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's the rabbi?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's Benny's dad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You sure?
- Yeah, Mr. Rosen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He comes into the cleaners sometimes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna go say hello.
- Why?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because he's looking for Benny,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I'm gonna point him
in the right direction.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mess with The Nose's head.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mr. Rosen, Doreen Di Nova,
from the Fluff and Fold.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Have you seen my son?
- Sure,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he's in the White Room. Come on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Know why they call it the
White Room, Mr.Rosen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause that's where they do the blow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cocaine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'd better stop talking, young man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't wanna know "or".</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right in there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, say shalomy to Benny for us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Man was pissed going into that room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't wanna be
Benny at that moment.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you're positive
it was Benny's father.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, who else would be at The Bell,
hanging out with a Frisbee on his head?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not a chance.
- Don't say that, Kite.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No judge is gonna sign a search warrant</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a b*llet. Just won't happen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So that's it?
- That's it. No sale.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Out of luck.
- Try again tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just like the exhumation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're still smarting about that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're supposed to be on the same
team here. / We are.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And my job, as your teammate, is to
let you know what's legally plausible.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This isn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about the city offering
some cash as incentive?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What i... what is this case anyway?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's a... disco m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Disco? / Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lookit.</line>
   <line type="music">♪ Well, you can tell by
the way I use my walk ♪</line>
   <line type="music">♪ I'm a woman's man, no time to talk...♪</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stop that, Kite.¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡
- We should go dancing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We should go dancing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No... no.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll take that as a maybe.
Huh? Whoo!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</line>
   <line type="dialogue">- # Huh, huh, huh, huh... #
- Kite, honestly...¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</line>
   <line type="dialogue">- # In love... #
- this could be a deal breaker.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Eh, this, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">this guy, the, uh...
with the slug in his a*s,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">is he in any trouble with the law?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Out an parole for a B and E.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let me talk to his parole officer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">See if he'll go for reduced parole in
exchange for getting that slug taken out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do I have to do anything in return?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why didn't you tell us you were
at the disco that night, Mr.Rosen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't see how it mattered.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your wife know you went
to see Benny that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In orthodox temples,
men and women sit apart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was gone and back
before the service was over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She didn't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did you say to your son?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's private.
- Not good enough, Mr.Rosen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't you wanna know who k*lled
your boy? The other people?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unless you already know.
- We know you got a temper.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And how betrayed you felt by Benny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think I k*lled my own son?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You had opportunity and motive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You disapproved of him.
You said so yourself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">For good reason.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you doing here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How can you pray in this cesspool?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's it matter where I pray,
huh, as long as I pray?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And what are you praying for?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To win a ridiculous dance contest?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or to get your hands on more blow?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't do that, Dad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come to temple with me.
It's Friday night. The Sabbath.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not gonna temple.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not gonna
dental school either, Dad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You choose this degradation
over your heritage?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is my heritage now, Dad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Disco. / Disco's a fad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your family, the temple,
that's your life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Disco's my life, Dad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right? It's not a fad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's here to stay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And so am I.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In fact...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna marry my dance partner,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the girl I love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The shiksa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You do and you'll never
step foot in my house again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then you're no longer my son.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I renounce you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's why I didn't tell you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why I never told my wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those were the last words
I ever spoke to my son.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I... renounce... you."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where'd you go after you left
the White Room, Mr.Rosen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went back to the temple.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And while I was praying,
my son was m*rder*d,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">burned to death.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kite did us a solid, swinging
that deal with Rigley.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rigley went for it pretty quick</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when he found out he
could miss a day of work.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sweeping up cigarette
butts in -degree weather</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can see taking curtain number two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Slug's in pretty good
condition, considering.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is it a match to Benny's b*llet?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Congratulations, Detectives.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You have twins.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Chaney was at the judges' table,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">all the way up until the fire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His g*n, but he didn't use it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about our two dancing
queens, Sonya and Doreen,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and the cabbie, Ken Mazzacone?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Alibi's held up. People saw
them all on the dance floor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And we verified David Rosen was back
in temple before the fire broke out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who are we overlooking?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Witnesses put Chaney at the judges'
table, but what about his son, Paul?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No statements about his whereabouts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just his own, right? Said he
was with his father all night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A father who's conveniently dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Little weasel like him, he'd know
where his dad kept his g*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he'd have access to the White Room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Only one problem, motive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why would Paul wanna
k*ll Benny Rosen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Paul Chaney was a little perv.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He have any beef with Benny?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Paul kind idolized Benny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wanted to dance like him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He any good?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Total klutz.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was always showing
off for Benny, "Watch me"</line>
   <line type="dialogue">like an annoying kid brother, you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He show off for Benny
the night of the fire?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Earlier that day he did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were rehearsing a number...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, Benny, can I cut in?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're kind of working
on a move here, Paul.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know, the Argentinean Tango.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can do it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Watch me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's not bad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Really?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Think I could dancer one
day like you, Benny?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, Paul. Just keep practicing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I will. 'Cause, one day,
I'm gonna be the king like you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, Doreen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny says I'm a good dancer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't let it go to your head.
He thinks Sonya's good, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dance with me, Doreen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, all right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come with me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why would a disco queen like
Doreen let Paul feel her up?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Owner's son, maybe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where was Doreen taking the kid?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Toward the White Room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Me and that little twerp?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What, are you nuts?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">According to Sonya, you guys
were all over each other.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was all over me, more like it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why'd you let Paul grope you like that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I fet sorry for him.
- You take him back to the White Room?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We talked to your dancing partner Ken.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How's he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ken says he can't remember</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you being on the dance floor
with him before the fire started.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't believe this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're trying to pin
Benny's m*rder on me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got motive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And without an alibi,
you got opportunity.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unless you give us
good reason not to...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're gonna have to arrest you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The hell you are.
I didn't k*ll Benny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then who did?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I swear.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just wanted to win.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here's the deal, you little horndog.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm listening.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny always comes in here
right before dancing, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">While he's doing whatever he does,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you sneak in wearing a ski mask,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">whack him one on the knee.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Use a baseball bat, a tire iron,
anything that'll do the job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you'll let me make it with you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You knock Benny out of the contest,
I'll let you do whatever you want.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The only thing the little twerp
was supposed to do</line>
   <line type="dialogue">was wallop Benny on the leg,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">put him out of commission.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But instead he k*lled him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then torched the place.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what
Paul did or didn't do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was on the dance floor
like I told you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, God.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't want any permanent
harm to come to Benny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But the thought of that
talentless b*tch Sonya</line>
   <line type="dialogue">winning the contest
and wearing the tiara.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I couldn't let that happen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You gotta understand</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was better than her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Way better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in the first degree, Paul.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I want a lawyer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't blame you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Won't make a difference.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got physical evidence.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's the slug from
Benny Rosen's skull.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's the slug from your dad's g*n,
one you threw in the Delaware.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe you forgot,
you shot a burglar back in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're a perfect match, Paul.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So we know the b*llet that k*lled
Benny came from your dad's g*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which you had access to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Plus Doreen told us
about your little deal</line>
   <line type="dialogue">knock Benny out of the contest,
get some action in returen</line>
   <line type="dialogue">except you knocked him out permanently.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do you live with yourself, Paul?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Knowing you k*lled the
disco king you worshipped,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not to mention other people?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if you count your dad
who drank himself to death.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't k*ll those people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forensics says you did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So does Doreen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It wasn't my fault.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whose was it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">it was Benny's fault.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Paul, what the hell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Benny, I can explain.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get off of me, you little twerp,
before I kick your a*s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you calling me that for, Benny?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All I ever wanted to do was be like you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You, like me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're the worst disco dancer in Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think you're such hot stuff,
hogging up all the foxes for yourself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you ain't such
hot stuff now, are you?</line>
