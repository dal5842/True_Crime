   <line type="dialogue">I read the paper.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, we've got minutes left.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't have a resolution.

   <line type="dialogue">Your resolution is supposed
to be about you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forget me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is the century

   <line type="dialogue">To the new century.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And a brand new start.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ten, nine, eight, seven,
six, five, four, three...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Happy new year!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi, Gil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is Lilly Rush.
The lady I was telling you about.</line>

   <line type="dialogue">Terrible, actually.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tami's four years sober.
She got her chip tonight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That doesn't sound terrible to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It doesn't change what I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which was what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Four years ago I had hit rock bottom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was new year's eve, the millennium.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, party like it's .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you did?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And then that night</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hit someone with my car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She can't tell you more than that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tami's what they
call a blackout drunk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I saw on the news the next day,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a man named Greg Cardiff
was k*lled that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A hit and run.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never came forward until now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What makes you think you
did it if you can't remember?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It happened in Bella Vista.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where I was bar
hopping that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">After about : ,
I'm blank until the next day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Find any damage to your car?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A dent on the hood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A broken headlight and blood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think I mowed that
poor man down that night</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and then just drove away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Greg Cardiff, ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">first m*rder of the millennium.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tami's right. This was the only
unsolved auto-ped the first half of .</line>

Christian in Bella Vista.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pronounced at midnight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Happy, frigging New Year.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had a wife and a year old son.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any witnesses?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nobody saw or heard nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably all hung over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Be worth going back, re-interviewing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks like they only talked
to of the neighbors.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This last one, Russell Brinkley didn't respond
to phone calls or cards left at the door.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe out of town?
Holiday travel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not a holiday now.
- Your friend still got her car?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe we can match the damage
to these crime scene photos.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, she hid it in a garage for a year,
then junked it in Wilmington.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But she gave us a picture.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's take it around. Maybe somebody
will recognize her or the car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bella Vista is a tight neighborhood.
Before we start knocking on doors,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we better tell the widow
we're looking back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anything I can do?
- You did a lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bringing us Tami.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Some AA buddy I am, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Convincing her to come forward,
could land her in prison.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's the cops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives Rush and Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's wrong? What happened?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing is wrong.
We're here about Greg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about him? / We may have
a new direction on the hit and run.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gary, maybe you should...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can we show you a picture?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry. I...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The last four years have been...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">she cried for the first three.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Still wear your wedding band, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, actually, I just got
remarried a few months ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Congratulations.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I'll do whatever I can to help.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you recognize her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe from the bar that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, she doesn't look familiar,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but the jeep does.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Greg wasn't feeling well that
night so I walked him out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let me go back
and get Mel and Jill.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll drive you. / I've got to play
hockey with Gary tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not feeling like this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think I feel better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just got to walk. Get some air.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll go with you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I want you to go back in and
celebrate the millennium with Jill and Mel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll meet you at home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll be there by : .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">See you next century.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If only I had gone with him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom, how could you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So the jeep was outside the bar
just before midnight?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If not that one, one just like it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What position do you play?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Goalie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He made varsity in ninth grade.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What, is this guy deaf?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Same guy who avoided talking
to the cops first time around.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, Brinkley, Open up!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's in there.
- Philadelphia PD!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We just saw you get the mail!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Answer this door!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll check around back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not leaving until
you open this door!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi, there.
- Oh, crap.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pretty much.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't see anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This guy saw something, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something like Tami
running over Greg Cardiff?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whatever it was,
he don't want to tell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unresponsive four years back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tried to ditch Vera
and Jeffries today.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Homebody like him, probably
wasn't out New Year's Eve.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let me guess where you were.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd it go with Greg's widow?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She saw a red jeep outside
the bar that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Red jeep, like Tami drove.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was hoping things
wouldn't point to her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's a nice lady.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice or not,
no one gets a free m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vera says this guy
Russell's got demophobia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fear of? / Crowds.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So crowd him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I told you I mind my own business.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mind if we join?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">More the merrier.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Russell here,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">overlooking the street where Greg got hit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That doesn't mean I saw anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detective Valens.
How are you doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is there a bigger room?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is the only one open.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Open is not what I'd call it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It is kind of small, isn't it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cozy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even if I saw something...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't want to get involved.
- Why not?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was four years ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wouldn't be able
to make charges stick.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Actually our batting average
is pretty good, Russell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I got to live in my neighborhood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So it was a neighbor?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A neighbor you're afraid of?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't say that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Russell, I'm appealing
to your decency here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think you're a decent person.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did you see that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something I wish I hadn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're sure it was
a brown Continental?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Positive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everyone in Bella
Vista knew that car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You saw it coming,
you went the other way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know the owner?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This jerk named John Butler.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You scared of Butler?
- That make me less of a man?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell us about him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's a rotten guy, mean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Makes life hell for
everyone who lives there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He k*lled Harriet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's Harriet?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My poodle.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Butler sicced his pitbull on her
because she chewed up his newspaper.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was a puppy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you sure he hit Greg?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably on purpose, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, this guy's gonna k*ll me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll protect you, Russell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I read crime novels.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You can't do nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm getting out of town.
You guys need me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll be at my mom's in Pittsburgh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So where were
you January , ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, at Elisa's grandma's,
scarfing the brunch of the ages.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was one of them kooks thought
the world was gonna stop spinning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stockpiled hams, potatoes, eggs,
enough to last days and nights.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You been with her a while,
then, huh? Elisa?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kids when we met.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't believe
in making it official?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's complicated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like you and Kite, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She do something
you can't forgive?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah. She, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She got sick. She...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She went to the
puzzle house for a while.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That bad, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remember that kid, uh, Barry,
on the Richardson job,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">heard the voices in the closet?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hear the meds really help...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">with that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. She's having
a good run now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for telling me, Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Should've brought your coat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. / Want mine?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wouldn't make you less of a man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd rather freeze now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're looking for John Butler.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you Butler?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Depends who's asking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I am.
- I didn't do nothing to no one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, why is that
so hard to believe?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You a cop, too?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got to admire
a piece with a piece.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe when we're done here,
I could buy you a steak.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vegetarian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">John, you remember a guy from the
neighborhood named Greg Cardiff?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Knew him, till someone
turned him into roadkill.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You have a personal
relationship with Greg?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We didn't travel
in the same circles.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because we have a witness
who saw you run him down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're just trying to figure
if this was an accident or m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, ho. Whoever
said that is full of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't hit no one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you were arrested
for drunk driving in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then again in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not a big stretch you'd be out
drunk driving new year's eve.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three counts
of as*ault and battery,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">public nuisance complaints.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We even heard you turned your
pit bull loose on a poor little dog.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That mutt was a yappy little b*tch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I did the neighborhood a favor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, well, we're gonna do
the neighborhood a favor now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bring you in, impound your car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't even have that car no more.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Matter of fact, I didn't have it
that new year's, neither.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Convenient.
- Happens to be true.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got stolen that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, you got to pay first.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three bucks a gallon? / Look, there
might not be any gas tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was here last week.
It was a buck and a quarter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It, it's the owner, okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He says this Y K thing's got
people willing to pay big.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's price gouging.

   <line type="dialogue">Hey, I been filling up here since
before you could get a woody, kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I'm sorry, okay?
It's not up to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.

   <line type="dialogue">Turn that pump on!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Turn your pump on!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You report your car stolen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That night. They found it stripped
in Jersey two days later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Check for yourself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Call me about that steak.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">John Butler?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everyone knows him and hates him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Greg know him, too?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unfortunately.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In fact, he saw him that afternoon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Butler confronted us at the market.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was with Greg.
- This is my husband, Mel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel Davis. / Hey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good friend of Greg's at college.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were all together
that New Year's Eve.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The three of you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jill, Mel's ex-wife, was also there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you two are married now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know. It's weird.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gary tells us all the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel was really
good to Gary and me</line>
   <line type="dialogue">after we lost Greg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And, uh, Jill left me that year
for greener pastures.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Namely, a cardiologist.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Four years later, here we are.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice for both of you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I told Mel you were asking
about a red jeep.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got new information now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Points to Butler.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Butler drove a Continental.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell us about seeing him that day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, Greg and
I went on a beer run,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and, uh, Butler was waiting
for us in the parking lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So who do you like,
Minnesota or Oregon?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oregon's not even ranked.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gophers are gonna destroy them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, Cardiff!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You scratched my car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What? / Door of your
f*g-mobile nicked my door.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you kidding?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was I talking to you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't think I even
touched it, John.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Saw it with my own eyes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm real sorry if I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That don't cut it.
- Hey, idiot,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">look at your car, look at Greg's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, you tell me, who should
be worried about scratches?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel, it's not worth it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you want to talk to me like that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll drop both of you right here!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whoa. Whoa. John...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I apologize, John.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Won't happen again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Happy new year, okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Moron.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Butler was looking for a fight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I got to admit,
I egged him on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think he hit Greg that night
on purpose to get back at him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If he did, we'll find out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thought you didn't have a beef
with Greg Cardiff, John.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't. / You had a run-in
with him the day he died,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">bitched him out
for dinging your car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was nothing. / Greg and his pal
called you an idiot a moron,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and you don't seem like
the type just looks away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I told you, my car was stolen
before Cardiff got slammed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You made that report at : A.M.,
An hour after Greg was k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Plenty of time to ditch
the car, report it missing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kid at the station wouldn't let
me use the phone to call the cops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had to walk there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, we talked to that kid.
- So he'll tell you it was stolen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He don't want to tell nothing
to help you, John, no one does.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But a lot of people are willing
to testify against you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">talk about your poor character.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have a -year-old oak
tree in our front yard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">While we were at church,
Butler took a chainsaw to it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That, that thing shed
its leaves onto my lawn.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Butler ran into my year old
daughter on her way to school.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Called her a whore.
- I said they dress her that way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got to remember
how young boys think.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">John asked me out
three or four times.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I politely declined.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He spray-painted 'whore'
on my front door.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's your point?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What goes around comes around.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All these neighbors are gonna be
more than happy to help put you away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You had a beef with Greg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got an eyewitness puts
your car at the crime scene.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And plus character witnesses
to say this guy's got to be guilty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not the guy you really want,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I can help you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're listening.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My car was stolen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I had a guy do it for me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hired him, you know...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for the insurance money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Keep talking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He must've hit Cardiff when he was
going to ditch the car in Jersey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Trevor McKai.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lives over in Bridesburg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You Trevor?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Want to talk to you about
a hit-and-run a while back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Over in Bella Vista.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Happened New Year's Eve
at the millennium.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Were you over that way?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hmm. Bella Vista?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, I was out with friends
here in Bridesburg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We need the names of those friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't really know their names.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not good friends, then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, I was just
hanging out with people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Partying and whatnot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Somebody's house? At a bar?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This bar, maybe?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. / Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forget it, man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've been waiting four years
for you guys to show up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got something you want
to get off your chest?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I could tell you your rights.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't need them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was me that hit that guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Driving John Butler's stolen car?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No kidding.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had no choice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What the hell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, god.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hit him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not denying it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but the man was already down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That doesn't make sense, Trevor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm telling you...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that Greg Cardiff</line>
   <line type="dialogue">wasn't crossing that street.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was lying in it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guy says Greg was face down
in the street before he ran him over?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's his story.
- Do we believe it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, Trevor's got reason to lie,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Greg wasn't feeling good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why he went home early.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Heart attack? Aneurysm?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about sloppy drunk?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was New Year's Eve.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's ask the wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We didn't have this new direction,
I'd take a hard look at Susan and Mel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was thinking the same thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyone got a favor coming
from the coroner's office?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ain't going to the morgue.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The smell of that place kills me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Listen to the kitchen b*tch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Being an auto-ped, probably didn't
do a full tox screen at autopsy, but</line>
   <line type="dialogue">maybe they saved
some tissue samples.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I'll give them a call.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right after you disinfect the phone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Greg wasn't drunk that night.
He was sick.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sick? How?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, we didn't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was off and on for about a month.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he felt good that day
until we got to the bar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind of symptoms he have?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Headache. Nausea. Why?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's possible Greg collapsed on
the street before he got hit by the car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From what? / Did he have
any kind of chronic condition?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. He was a health nut.
He jogged every day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He played hockey with Gary.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gary was sick that day, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Same symptoms?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think so.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where's Gary now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I was sick, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Headache, nausea,
same as your dad?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's that have to do
with him getting hit?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His health that night
might have been a factor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anything else you remember
about your symptoms?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think I was seeing things
kind of yellow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">filter over everything I saw.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you and your dad share any
of the same foods that day?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dad ate something that mom cooked.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And, uh, I had fast food.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about chips or pretzels
watching the game?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But there was
something else we shared.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, there he is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good scrimmage?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry about this morning, Gare.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's all right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm better today. How about tomorrow
we set up the net in the driveway?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, cool.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because your mom loves when
we slam pucks against the garage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I do love it very much.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyone need anything?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No thanks, honey.
- No thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, hey, hey.
- Gary, what are doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know better.
- Sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got a few years
to go there, kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe I got sick from
drinking from the same glass.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Mel and your mom were both mad
that you touched that margarita?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't see what the big deal was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was only a sip.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Father and son drink
the same margarita,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">both fall sick.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Susan and Mel are both there, both could
have slipped something into the drink.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And they take big pains
to stop the kid from drinking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because dad is the target.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fast forward four years and the
widow and best friend are married.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe they were seeing each other,
decided to get rid of Greg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I want find Mel's ex.
See if she suspected an affair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Visitor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">At least there's good
news for someone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why don't you go talk to Mel,
Scotty, man to man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi, Tami.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for coming in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You have news?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It wasn't you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, that's great.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're sure?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone confessed
to hitting Greg Cardiff that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And there's an eyewitness
to back the story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I confessed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To what you thought you did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about the blood,
the damage to my car?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe an animal.
Maybe you did hit someone,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">injured them. But</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we only have
homicide records here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Point is,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you didn't k*ll anyone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you want it to be you, Tami?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I quit drinking because
I thought I hit this guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was keeping me in check.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now I...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I really want a gin and tonic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're thinking food poisoning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And that he just fell
in front of this car?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've seen stranger things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, crap.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You okay there, Mel?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Knocks the wind out of your sails
when you hear something like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was my best friend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd he get the food poisoning?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe the margarita
he was drinking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Really.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gary says he took a sip of
his dad's drink that day,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and you kind of swatted
it out of his hand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I might have.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How come?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was only .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, he's still not
old enough to drink.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can I...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">ask you an aside here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ain't judging, believe me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and Susan...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you really take up after Greg's death?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. / Because I know if I'm
you and I'm looking at her</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and she's interested back...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, married or not,
the flesh is weak.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe it makes me a real geek,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but no.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was faithful.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, better man than me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, uh, the margaritas...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you remember who made them?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rolling rock, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You guys are really living it up.
- Or it reminds us of our college days.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wouldn't you rather
have a margarita?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel? / Oh, no.
I don't drink tequila.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ever since hell night freshman year.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel did sh*ts in minutes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I still get sick thinking about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ended up in
student health for three days.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My parents almost
sued the fraternity.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm, uh, good with this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Susan made the margaritas,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and the margaritas made Greg sick.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't like what
you're suggesting.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just adding up the facts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I'll say it again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There was no love
triangle before Greg died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Would your ex-wife
back that up? / Sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jill's the one who
left me for another man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Know where we can find Jill? / No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're out of touch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who was the doctor
she ended up with?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Michael... something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jill left you for this guy,
and you never got his name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, if your wife tells you
that she's screwing another guy,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that's really all you need to know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anything else is just
salt in the wound.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Found Jill davis or at least
her answering machine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good. because Mel's either a great liar
or didn't have nothing to do with this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, someone definitely
wanted Greg Cardiff dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get something from the coroners?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No tissue samples,
but Greg was an organ donor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Transplant unit at Pennsylvania Hospital
had some blood samples stored.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lethal levels of digoxin.
- What's that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Medication used to stabilize
an irregular heart beat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And it can be deadly
if you want it to be.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Overdose symptoms
are nausea, headache,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gary's symptoms.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And fainting. / Maybe why
Greg dropped in the street.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guess who's in
the emergency room.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel davis.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Exact same symptoms as Greg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We found digoxin in his system.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what digoxin is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Prescription drug.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you use it wrong,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">it's just poison.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I've never heard of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All that cooking and
catering you do, Susie,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">be pretty easy to slip a few lethal
drops into dinner every night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have to get to the hospital.
- Are you tired of Mel, is that it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was good to you and all,
just like Greg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe you just had your fill of him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I love Mel.
- You know about black widows?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're beautiful, but deadly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Destroy their mates when
their usefulness is over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't hurt my husband.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got to be more specific, Susie.
Which husband do you mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The one already dead,
or the one in the hospital?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I was unhappy with Mel,
why wouldn't I just get a divorce?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe you just
don't like confrontation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yellow-tinted vision?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's weird, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're running a million tests.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where'd you have your last meal?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something Susan made?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel, there was a drug called
digoxin in Greg's system.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A lethal amount.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What is that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A heart medication.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think they're gonna find that
in your system, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your partner's already been
down this road with me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Susan wouldn't harm me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And she never
would have hurt Greg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She adored him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe she adored you more.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">At least for a while.
- It was always him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Greg was plan A.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm just the one she settled for.
- But the fact remains, Mel,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">symptoms as Greg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know the name
of her business?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cardiff Catering.
She still uses his name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's how loyal she is to him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jill's there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go ahead. I'll be there in ten.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You talking about my Jill?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We tracked her down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Want me to give her a message?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No message.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel always had it bad for Susan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even when you
were married to him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't like to think so,
but you know in your gut.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's the reason why we broke up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought you left him
for a cardiologist.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Only because I didn't feel like
waiting around for the affair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was there an affair? / No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Susan would never leave Greg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wasn't until after he died
that Mel saw his opening.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, yeah.
Two days after the funeral,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he wanted me to draw up papers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not too subtle. / No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, Jill, you being
married to a heart doctor,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you probably know what digoxin is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. I take it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I met my husband because
of my heart condition.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hospital confirmed Mel
was poisoned with digoxin.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just like Greg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably no surprise to Susie here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And turns out Mel's ex-wife has been
taking that drug her whole life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think Jill did something?
- Jill's over Mel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She has a new husband.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And she never had
anything against Greg.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Mel, on the other hand...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel had real good access
to digoxin over the years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Mel and Greg eat
a lot of meals together?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go out drinking?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were best friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">According to Jill,
Mel had big plans for you</line>
   <line type="dialogue">soon as Greg got out of the picture.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who else could
it have been, Susie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, no.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember something?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought he was
just being a friend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But even on the day
of the funeral...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel was moving in?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw a guy get a ticket on my way
to the cemetery and I just...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">didn't understand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Understand what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How the world keeps going.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, how do people do mundane
things, like write up a ticket,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when everything is over?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Baby, I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's not over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're gonna be happy again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The three of us are
all going to stick together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're all gonna be happy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The three of us?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When he was still married to Jill.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But why would
Mel make himself sick?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He never thought Greg's
poisoning would come out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Knowing it would,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tried to set you up, Susie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hospital just called.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel davis skipped out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Driver, remove the
keys from the ignition.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Throw the keys out of the window.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tracked him through his cell phone.
He's not responding to orders.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what's he doing? / Fugitives
don't usually think before they run.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My guess is, he's thinking now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can I try?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel, this is detective Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Show us your hands.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please put your hands
outside the window.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He got a g*n?
- I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We give him much more time,
maybe we'll find out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Careful.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got the driver's side.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's gone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll call the coroner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mel wasn't thinking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was writing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's it say?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My millennium resolution
was to have a family,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">kids and all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Susan and Gary were that family.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But even after Greg was gone,
even though she married me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was never more than plan B.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's have our own toast,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">just the guys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The year .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What? What is it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't think Jill and
I are gonna make it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You serious?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I couldn't say it in front of her,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I'm gonna make
some changes in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's my real resolution.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Marriage is hard work, Mel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Problem is,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got the wrong marriage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Me, too.</line>
