   <line type="dialogue">Don't make me tie
you up, Red Feather.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just come quiet and civilized.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll scalp you first, White Man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Grace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sheriff's back, men.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry to hear that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry to hear that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know you're working on it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I miss you, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Boss has something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, I gotta jet, Elisa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna try to come this week.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can't promise anything,
but best effort. Bye.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone left this on the
steps of St. Emilian's Church.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unknown boy found in box.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">April , ."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Will, take a look at this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, that old job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Boy in the box.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even I heard of that one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">City's most famous cold job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've seen this up in
the comissioner's office.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Still nags the bosses.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They never so much
as I.D.'d the boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everyone in Philly
knew about this kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The unknown boy."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But week after week,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">no one reported him missing,
and no one could name him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where's the body end up?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charity Field... with
the paupers and prisoners.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any tags on those?
- Nah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Think the unknown boy
could be this little cowboy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lil, there's something on the back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His name was Arnold."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unknown white male, .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dumped in Fox Chase."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Better known as the Boy in the Box.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in Philadelphia and Bucks County.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hundreds of leads,
none of them right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kid was found in a Liho
Punch box, out in a field.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They tried to trace the box in
Schools and restaurants.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They got nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know how he died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Undetermined.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look at the head wounds.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look at the hair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's the deal?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One detective thought he was
k*lled while getting a haircut.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Homicidal barber?
That's a cracked theory.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Check this out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cops put the body in clothes,
propped him up</line>
   <line type="dialogue">thinking it would make him
more recognizable.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Creepy.
- They didn't think so in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not that I was on the force then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We weren't thinkin' that, Pops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The college kid who found the box
turned into a frequent flyer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He came to Homicide times
about the case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got obssessed?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or was guilty about something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably want to set
up visit number .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So who do we think
left the suitcase?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone who's been keeping
a secret a long time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's see if we can
get prints off it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We've got the name "Arnold",</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and we've got this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe someone with younger eyes</line>
   <line type="dialogue">can read the lettering on that bus?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fernwood Home for orphans."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sisters Vivian Dole and Grace Ashley
ran the Fernwood Home in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They still got orphanages in Philly?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, we got the outstanding
foster care system instead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nuns. / What about them?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tough ladies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">At least the ones who taught me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm afraid Sister Grace died recently.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She gave years to the Church.
That's a life well-lived.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and her ran
the Fernwood Orphanage in ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From ' to ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We had up to boys and
girls at any given time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You must know these boys, then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They look like Fernwood children.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I couldn't tell you the names.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about a boy named Arnold?
Remember him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wore a cowboy hat?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's possible.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw so many children
come and go, I just...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't remember them all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you hear about the Boy
in the Box case, back in ' ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't think so.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kid was dumped in Fox Chase?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was all over the city.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We lead private lives here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We read morning prayers,
not morning papers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know the orphanage is gone now</line>
   <line type="dialogue">from Fernwood somewhere.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I believe they're all
in the basement.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I'm sure you don't want
to sift through all that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Actually, we love that kind of thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you're welcome to look.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There was one Arnold
at Fernwood that year,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold Culliver.
Six years old.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So the Boy in the Box has a name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have intake and adoption
records for him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who adopted him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rubin and Lila Hanson, April .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two days before he was
found in that field.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was better off at the orphanage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those parents got a lot to explain.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll track them down.
I want to meet these people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold came to Fernwood in
' with a sister, Gretchen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can we find her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a Gretchen Culliver
listed in, uh, Roxborough.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Working in the city library.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You get the names of those
other kids at Fernwood?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can figure out who the
rest of these boys are.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe if the sister gives her DNA,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">make a positive I.D.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're gonna need an ADA's
help on this one, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know anyone?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Want to go talk to Gretchen?
- Sure thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold Culliver was my brother,
but this isn't him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know it's hard to look at.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that's not my brother.
Arnold had curls; blonde curls.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is he one of these boys, Gretchen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, that's him with his
Science Club friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where'd you get that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone left it,
along with this circular.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that dead boy can't be Arnold.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was adopted in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Vivian said there's a family
coming that wants a little boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They can't have me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wish they wanted a girl, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I won't go, Gretch.
- You have to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even if we get separated.
You know our plan, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Meet at the horses.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My th birthday.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go to the Bryer Horse Fair,
meet you at the horses.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't forget.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ain't leaving you, Gretch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he was gone one morning,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">adopted late the night before.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never said good-bye to him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did, uh, you go looking
for him at the horse fair?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I did, actually.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He didn't show.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a lucky Arnold found a home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He acted up a lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There were two families before this one
who had taken him and brought him back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because of his behavior?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And if you got too old,
you didn't get adopted at all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were stuck at Fernwood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That what happened to you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I grew up there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any idea where Arnold went to live?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, they never told us
things like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I always imagined him with a nice
family on a horse farm somewhere.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So nice, he forgot Fernwood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was very young when he left.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gretchen,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">give us a DNA sample</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so we can compare it to this boy's?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I'd be glad to but I
know that's not my brother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd offer a refreshment, but
we don't got much in the house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No problem.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, what's it all about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got your name from
Gretchen Culliver, Roger.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From the Fernwood Home?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gretchen...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was she one of the older girls?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Her brother Arnold,
he was your age.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's the Science Club g*ng.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That Arnold was a cut-up.
- Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Leader of the pack, you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Drove the Sisters barking mad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll make a posse.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Find that old girl and
bring her on in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got the rope.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Freddy, got your spurs on?
- Got'em, Sheriff.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you think you're doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're going to the woods.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bedtime was an hour ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're gonna lasso a cow,
Sister Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There are no cows in the woods.
- That's what you think.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, he was kind of the
holy terror of Fernwood,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so, of course, uh, well,
we all loved him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why are you asking about him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're working a homicide from .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We think the victim
was probably Arnold.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, no.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could you look at a picture for us?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you think that might be Arnold?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold had blonde hair... curls.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And if his hair was cut off?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I couldn't say yes but...
I couldn't say no.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got two boys.
Adopted.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey. Anything off that suitcase?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just that it was bought
at Wannamaker's in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Only the biggest department
store in the city.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was before credit cards,
so no records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No prints on it either.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got the okay from the orphan's
court to exhume the boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is his sister gonna give us a swab?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's pretty committed to this
boy not being Arnold, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She better get uncommitted.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blonde curls or not,
that's the same kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Find any of the other
boys in the photo?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two others are dead besides Arnold.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One we just talked to.
- Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Says Arnold was a problem child.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If two different families took him in,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">then changed their mind,
he must have been.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Lila and Rubin bring him home,
he throws a fit right off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rubin gives him a paddling or
shakes him too hard, he ends up dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, what else do you do with a dead
kid besides dump him in a field?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe there's a reason
they're hard to trace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You can't find them?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No record of them anywhere
in Pennsylvenia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're trying the national database now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nut job.
O'clock.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Must be our rabbit guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good luck.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives Rush and Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Walter Rafferty. I was the
one to find that boy in the box.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for coming in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You have something new on the case?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Possibly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was about six years old.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wrapped in a blue blanket.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was : noon on Sunday,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I followed a
jackrabbit into the brush</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I came upon a box,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a-a-a Liho Punch box,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and there was the boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Inside.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't recognize him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. Absolutely not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You weren't involved with him dying?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Absolutely not.
I took a polygraph test in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know you did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll take one right now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gave the cops a straight story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You do any investigating yourself?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">As a matter of fact, I go back
to the site every year on April</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I'm not the only one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a woman who
goes out there, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I...I seen her there for years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. We've got that down here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She comes with white roses,
wearing a green plaid coat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ever talk to this woman?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I tried a few times.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She didn't want to engage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why is this whole Boy in the Box
thing so big in your life, Walter?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess you've seen
lots of dead bodies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doesn't bother you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I'm not built that way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This... this derailed me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wish I never saw that rabbit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think this Walter guy's
on the level, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just gotten messed up
by finding the body.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you think of his story
about the lady in the plaid coat?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even if it's true, what's it mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She could just be
an obssessive like him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How long you think this'll take?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One of your girls waiting for you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What I wouldn't give to take a
look at Scotty's black book?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know what? Forget it.
I can go tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Didn't want to miss the show, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We finally found records
on Rubin and Lila Hanson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, there's a reason
they were so hard to find.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They died in the .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold's parents don't exist.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rubin and Lila Hanson died
before the trun of the century.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Buried at the cemetery
at St. Emilian's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The same church where
the suitcase turned up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So the adoption papers are phony.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what happened to Arnold the
night he was supposedly adopted?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he died in the orphanage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone on the inside covered
it up with adoption records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here's another layer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Autopsy of our boy positively
I.D.'d him as Arnold Culliver</line>
   <line type="dialogue">from dental records, but, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold's DNA...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">doesn't match Gretchen's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So they're not brother and sister?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then Arnold's intake papers
were doctored, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So this kid came from
nowhere and went nowhere.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who signed these records?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And guess who's not talking now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In seclusion.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nun on the run.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ever staked out a convent?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll go anywhere.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gretchen's gonna take this hard.
- Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do we tell her that not only
did her brother die years ago,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but on top of that, he wasn't
actually her brother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This must be a mistake.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. No, I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold and I came to
Fernwood together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Our parents were k*lled
in a train wreck.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't have the
same parents, Gretchen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sisters Vivian and Grace
knew about this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think they must have.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And they kept it a secret
from me all this time?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were young.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe they were protecting you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gretchen, we know now that
Arnold was never adopted.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There was no family that
came and took him away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And right around that time,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">someone hurt him,
bad enough it k*lled him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The best explanation right now
is that he died at Fernwood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We need your help thinking about
who could have hurt him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was anyone ever violent with Arnold?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Freddy Baker.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's in that picture you have.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He beat Arnold up pretty bad once.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who else?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold got disciplined a lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">By who?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why are you back?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't like that family
and they didn't like me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They kick you out?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ran. There was no one to play with.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, Arnold, what do you
have to say for yourself?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good to be home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're pleased with
yourself, are you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Didn't hurt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold's coming to my office.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't, Sister Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never knew what she did
to him in her office,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but he came out with
a lot of bruises.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Would Sister Grace punish him too?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was always Sister Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ask Freddy Baker.
He ended up in her office a lot, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fernwood, ahhh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bad memories?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The worst.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry to bring it up,
but it's a homicide investigation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Boy named Arnold Culliver.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Crap.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's one of the few kids I liked.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The way I hear it, Fred,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">bully at Fernwood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I'd run around dropping
guys for looking at me funny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Real nice kid, you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ever drop Arnold?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But mostly I just left him alone
'cause he had spirit, you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gave the nuns hell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was popular, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">With the kids, yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Funny thing about him,
he loved it at Fernwood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everyone else wanted to get out,
he kept coming back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are your memories
of Sister Vivian?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mean old battle-ax.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's the reason I kept my
kids out of Catholic school.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She ever whale on you
enough to do damage?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was sadistic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you think she could have hurt
Arnold bad enough to k*ll him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you saying Arnold
died at Fernwood?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We don't know yet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought he got adopted.
- No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Vivian was pretty cruel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But m*rder?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It might have been accidental.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll tell you it got pretty bad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I still got scars on my back
from where she took the belt to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She used a belt, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">With me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She mixed it up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Spoons, paddles.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had a lot of tricks in her bag.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry as hell that kid died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're a hard lady to get to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm in seclusion.
- It'll only take a few minutes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not comfortable with this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, I'm not comfortable
with a few things myself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like Arnold's phony intake papers
and his phony adoption records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know anything about that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And the fact that his supposed
parents died in the s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm also uncomfortable with what I'm
hearing about the corporal punishment</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you gave out at Fernwood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Raising Children calls for discipline.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, you were extra rough
with Arnold Culliver.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had a serious behavior problem.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, now you remember him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because before, you
couldn't place him at all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, I remember Arnold.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was a troubled boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you just didn't feel like telling
me and my partner that before?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We lead private lives here,
and I believe in discretion.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't like prying eyes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because they might
discover what you did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't do anything out of
the ordinary to those children.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You left kids with lifelong scars.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe it sounds scandalous today,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but it was routine in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm. So maybe in a routine
pummeling of Arnold one night,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he fell unconscious
from one of your blows.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Died, in fact.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'd want to be discreet
about that event,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so maybe you cut off
those blonde curls</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so no one recognized him,
put him in a box,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and privately took him to a field
and dumped him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a remarkable thing
to say to a woman of God.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is it true?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why did you fake Arnold's intake
and adoption records?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your signature's on
both sets of papers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Grace did the paperwork</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I, as the senior sister at Fernwood,
signed the documents.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was Sister Grace as fond of
corporal punishment as you are?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I won't speak ill of the dead.
- Why did she fake the records?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why did she do any of the
stupid things that she did?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Grace was a screwup.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was weak-willed,
and she was unreliable</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and she couldn't
discipline the children,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and that's why I had to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's your name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's Arnold.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you like swimming, Arnold?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I like horses.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Afraid we don't have any of those,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">at the Haverford swimming pool.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Does that sound like fun?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pow, pow, pow, pow!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't socialize with
the parents so much.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold just shoved a woman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I told him, best behavior.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have to control him, Grace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'll never get a home if we don't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could Grace have hurt Arnold?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Grace...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Some stories shouldn't be told.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vivian claimed Grace was
the one to doctor the records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is she offering a reason why?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was mysterious about her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And conveniently, Grace is dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd it go with Fred the bully?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's a decent guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Adopted twins from Romania.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did he do in Arnold?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, but he confirmed
Sister Vivian was good and vicious.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Found the last kid in the
photo, it's Paul Evans.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He add anything to the picture?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">More of the same.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Loved Arnold,
terrified of Sister Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One thing struck us, though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He said he couldn't have kids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. First guy we found, Roger...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he adopted his kids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Fred adopted, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's what we mean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three out of the six boys on that photo
don't or can't have kids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe orphans are more likely
to adopt when they grow up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three out of six, Lil?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a cluster,
not a coincidence.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gretchen said this is a picture
of the Science Club boys, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe we need to find out
what they did at this club.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, the boys went to
the Science Club on Fridays,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">while the rest of us had music class.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Science Club wasn't at Fernwood?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, they went someplace else.
So, took that bus.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">By themselves?
- Sister Grace went with them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know what they did there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. It was only for boys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you don't know where it was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, but I think that picture you have</line>
   <line type="dialogue">was taken wherever the club was held.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That building's not Fernwood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe we blow this up?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Science Club was, um,
just a weekly field trip.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To where?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A hospital-type building.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind of things did you do there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was different every time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could you give us a for instance?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One time we had a breakfast
in the afternoon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hello, Doctor.
- Sister Grace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hello, boys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do we have to give
blood today, Dr. Thayer?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. Today all you have
to do is eat cornflakes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We just had lunch!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hope you're hungry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was fun.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing scary about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know Dr. Thayer's first name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Roger, we have to ask you
a personal question. / Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you adopt kids because
you couldn't have your own?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was your side,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not your wife's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd you know that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All three men still alive from
Science Club confirmed as sterile.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How you gonna blame that on cornflakes?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I don't know what it's got to do
with Arnold's head wounds, either.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta find out what else was
going on in this place, Lil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got a partial name on the building.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, H-O-something-I-N-something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Something... Institute?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hoover Institute, in Fairmount.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So let's look for anyone
who worked there in '</line>
   <line type="dialogue">starting with Dr. Thayer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got some, Lil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know what, I can go tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You've been saying that all
week, Scotty, but you never go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll meet you in
the morning, Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">First thing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">First thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right, you want me
to auto-track Thayer?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, maybe let me, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I got to learn how to run
this computer sometime, Lil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is it on?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry I'm late.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The bus was parked right over there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know what was going
on here in the ' s?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Government research.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dr. Milton Thayer
was using volunteers</line>
   <line type="dialogue">including the boys from Fernwood</line>
   <line type="dialogue">as test groups.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was Fernwood getting in return?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were paid a fee
for every boy they brought over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got the contracts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Vivian set this up?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Grace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind of tests are we talking?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's what we got to ask Dr. Thayer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's an emeritus researcher here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I remember the Fernwood boys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were subjects in a series
of radiation tests for us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Radiation.
- Right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We heard something about cornflakes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was one of the methods.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd that work?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The milk was irradiated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You gave radioactive milk
to six-year-old boys?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Very low levels.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We also put it in the toothphaste and
had them brush their teeth with it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This was government-sponsored?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're what, years old?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you don't remember the Cold w*r.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We lived in fear of the b*mb.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Radiation research was
considered necessary.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was even patriotic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you know your tests
left three men sterile?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We didn't intend to harm anyone,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but at the time, we were
working for a cause.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you don't regret the tests?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We worked within the boundaries
of what we knew.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Back in the ' 's, we thought
those tests would do us good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We also performed lobotomies,
which we now think are barbaric,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but at the time, it was considered
cutting-edge medicine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh-huh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can't help the times you live in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Sister Grace arranged
the visits to the Institute.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Think she knew what she
was doing to these kids?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was a nun, not a doctor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And back in ' ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the culture was,
doctor could do no wrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't question them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't question
the government, either.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They funded the tests.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Been looking into
what else was going on</line>
   <line type="dialogue">at the Hoover Institute in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A lot of behavioral research.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's that mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Trying to straighten out psychotics</line>
   <line type="dialogue">by way of insulin treatments,
isolation tanks, electroshock.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, God.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell me they didn't test
that on the orphans.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That would explain
Arnold's head wounds.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I auto-tracked an ancient nurse,
used to work in Behavior.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Still in Philly?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sally Thurber, old lady now,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">kicking it in a retirement community.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I remember that Boy in the Box case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never put it together
with Fernwood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No one did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those boys were darlings.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you know any of them?
Maybe they were research subjects?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, not for us. No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just saw them around the Institute
in their...little gray uniforms.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd talk to the nun
who brought them sometimes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister Grace?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She'd come down to
Behavior once in a while.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah? Why would she do that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I suppose everyone's dead now,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so I can speak out of school.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She'd come visit Clayton...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">an assistant in our lab,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a medical student,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and they were friendly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Friendly how?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, more friendly than a nun should
be with a young man, in my opinion.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's a good boy at heart,
but he acts up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You look beautiful, Grace. /Shh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't tell you that?
- Clay, he needs a family.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm worried he won't get
one if he doesn't change.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'll outgrow it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. It's getting worse.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please help him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what you want me to do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The treatment you give
the patients here...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's not for children.
- Does it work?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's very effective.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Calms them down, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know it could help him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Grace...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's an adoption party tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please. For me, Clay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you ever see the boy
they were talking about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That same night -- I was leaving,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw Grace again with
that little boy in tow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where were they going?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I assumed to see Clayton,
to get that treatment she asked for.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was that treatment?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">ECT.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shock treatment.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I remember that night,
because that's the only time</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ever saw Grace out of her habit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never even knew
she had blonde hair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was she wearing that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A plaid coat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A green plaid coat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds like Sister Grace and Clayton
were some kind of item.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he knew how to administer ECT,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">which was supposed to
control wild behavior.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And she wanted a boy controlled
for an adoption party.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There was a party
at Fernwood on April .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The day before Arnold was found.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So maybe on April ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Grace and Arnold secretely
come to the Institute.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's wearing lay clothes
so no one recognizes her...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Except for Sally the busybody.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's in a green plaid coat,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">just like the woman our Rabbit Guy
saw in that field over the years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably Grace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And before you give shock treatment,
you cut off the patient's hair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Grace had the same coat,
all those years?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How many coats does a nun have?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why does she go to such
lengths for this kid</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when she's got kids who need help?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Why Arnold?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sally makes it sounds like
Grace and Clayton had a relationship.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We still don't know who
Arnold's parents were.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And why Grace doctored
those intake records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's sacrilegious.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lil, she was a nun.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was also human.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can talk here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You probably don't want the sisters
overhearing this conversation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What is it now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We think we know who
Arnold's mother was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't want to tell
the story of Grace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know you didn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But a little boy died, Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her little boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Grace was... not a good nun.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No kidding.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was dreamy. Weak.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She had good intentions,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">she just didn't have self-control.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know Clayton Waters?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was Grace's ruin.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was in love with him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Till the day she died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When she was ,
she came to me</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and told me she was pregnant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I probably should have
just told Mother Superior,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but instead, I helped her go
away for a few months.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and Grace were close?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like blood sisters.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She promised to leave the baby
at a Pittsburgh orphanage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But she just couldn't,
and so she brought him back to Fernwood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And slipped him in
as Gretchen's brother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He became our cross to bear.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Misbehaving all the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Couldn't hold on to a family.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he was getting older,
less adoptable.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did he know Grace was his mother?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We never told him...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I think a part of him knew
that he was home with Grace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why he kept coming back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what happened to
Arnold on April ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, April ... well...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">On April , Grace was
desperate to find him a home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Before I tell you the rest,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I want you to know that
everything Grace did,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">she did because she loved him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vivian. Vivian!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you wearing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arnold's sick.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What in the world happened?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Clayton treated him.
To help him behave.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're not supposed to see Clayton.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We had to cut his hair off,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">his beautiful hair...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Clayton say he'd
be sick like this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He said he might feel tired, but...
Vivian, he's got such a fever.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have to pray for him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought it would help.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'd behave, and then some couple
would want him, and keep him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Say a prayer, Grace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was supposed to calm him,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to control him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Grace never dreamt
it would be harmful.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Arnold make it to
the adoption party?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, his fever got worse.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're out of punch, Sister Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm.. th-there's a new
box in the kitchen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where's Arnold?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'll be down soon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go talk to people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's going, Vivian.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll... meet you...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, Arnold...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hope you know I loved you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">... I'll meet you at the horses.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Clean the room up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanna come.
- Grace!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is not one of
your little screwups.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is very serious.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm coming, too.</line>
