   <line>You waste your money

   <line>Every morning.
- Five bucks down the drain.</line>
   <line>I don't got dependents.
I can afford it.</line>
   <line>So if you won big, you'd retire?
- Nah. I'd stay doing what I do.</line>
   <line>I'd just dress sharper...
if that's possible...</line>
   <line>If that's possible.</line>
   <line>Lil, you want to take a look at this?</line>
   <line>What is it?</line>
   <line>Regional broadcast
from Delaware State Police.</line>
   <line>They just got a m*rder similar to
a cold job in Jersey.</line>
   <line>Young white male,
walked into the woods,</line>
   <line>Both were hitchhikers.</line>
   <line>Motive?
- Straight robbery.</line>
   <line>b*llet in both cases was . caliber.</line>
   <line>Requesting information on
any like murders,</line>
   <line>solved or unsolved, in the region."</line>
   <line>What, they think they got
a serial m*rder?</line>
   <line>Sounds like it.
- Nice. I'll check the H-records.</line>
   <line>We had a job like that.</line>
   <line>Yeah, a kid hitchhiking.</line>
   <line>Five, six years ago.
Danny Saltzman's job.</line>
   <line>Saltzman. Right.</line>
   <line>What do you remember about it?</line>
   <line>It was in the Summer.
And just like you said,</line>
   <line>in the forest, hitchhiker, . slug.</line>
   <line>Remember his name?</line>
   <line>I should remember.</line>
   <line>Saltzy brayed on and on about that kid.</line>
   <line>There wasn't much on it,
some footprints, fiber.</line>
   <line>Yeah, he just turned ,
uh... "Gone good."</line>
   <line>Saltzman was always saying.</line>
   <line>Crummy kid gone good", over and over.</line>
   <line>He was a good-looking kid.</line>
   <line>Saltzman had his picture taped up
on the wall.</line>
   <line>Damn, this name thing's gonna bug me.</line>
   <line>You ever establish who the kid
caught a ride with?</line>
   <line>Nah, case went cold fast.</line>
   <line>Dean... I think his name was Dean.</line>
   <line>No, it wasn't Dean.</line>
   <line>Darren... Darren something.
- No.</line>
   <line>Matt.</line>
   <line>What?
- Mills. Matt Mills.</line>
   <line>Right. That's it.</line>
   <line>Yeah. Almost had it.</line>
   <line>Matt Mills, ,</line>
   <line>shot in the woods off the Expressway.</line>
   <line>The , bucks he'd just won
in Atlantic City, gone.</line>
   <line>Like the other two jobs.</line>
   <line>I talked to Jersey and Delaware,
both are thinking it's the same doer.</line>
   <line>Serial k*ller.</line>
   <line>Our guy Matt could've been his first.</line>
   <line>Well, Matt's k*lled in ' .</line>
   <line>Jersey's body turns up fall of .</line>
   <line>And Delaware's just four weeks ago.</line>
   <line>A three-year cooling off period.</line>
   <line>I say we go right now.
To Delaware.</line>
   <line>No need.
Delaware's coming here.</line>
   <line>Don't get too excited, Scotty.</line>
   <line>A serial job don't get you
hopped up just a little, boss?</line>
   <line>What else do we know
about the victims, Lil?</line>
   <line>All young guys, to .</line>
   <line>All three were headed home
from Atlantic City</line>
   <line>after winning a few thousand
in the casinos.</line>
   <line>So the doer hangs around the tables,</line>
   <line>st*lks the winners,
catches up to them</line>
   <line>on the lonely road home.</line>
   <line>These kids are leaving
with thousands of bucks.</line>
   <line>Why are they hitchhiking?</line>
   <line>File says Matt missed his bus back.</line>
   <line>I could win ten grand over there,</line>
   <line>I still ain't paying a cabbie
bucks to drive me home.</line>
   <line>Now, you put it that way,
I guess my tumb's out too.</line>
   <line>Besides the robbery and the . ,</line>
   <line>we got a size ten print that
lines up with other murders.</line>
   <line>Plus the gray carpet fiber
on the body.</line>
   <line>Delaware and Jersey
have a list of seven suspects</line>
   <line>that could've done both jobs.</line>
   <line>Add in this m*rder,
maybe we narrow it down even more.</line>
   <line>Vera and Jeffries can check
the list, see if anyone</line>
   <line>had ties to Philly in ' .</line>
   <line>Hmm. / What?</line>
   <line>When Matt was ,</line>
   <line>my Sergeant at West Detectives.</line>
   <line>For what?</line>
   <line>Him and his cousin robbed
a food mart. Got probation.</line>
   <line>I'll put a call in,
see if he remembers Matt.</line>
   <line>Good.</line>
   <line>Better get to the family, Lil.</line>
   <line>Let them know what's going on.</line>
   <line>Hello.</line>
   <line>What's your name?</line>
   <line>Katie.</line>
   <line>I'm Detective Rush.
- Detective Valens.</line>
   <line>Are your parents home?</line>
   <line>Is it about Matt?</line>
   <line>How'd you know?</line>
   <line>Whenever it's cops,
it's about Matt.</line>
   <line>So Matt was in Atlantic City</line>
   <line>Blaine that weekend?</line>
   <line>Matt hadn't seen Blaine
for a long time,</line>
   <line>he wanted to go whoop it up with him.</line>
   <line>Yeah, he'd earned it.</line>
   <line>How so?</line>
   <line>He was working for a brokerage house.</line>
   <line>An entry level position,
but a good start.</line>
   <line>He'd gotten into computers,
that investment world.</line>
   <line>It was impressive.</line>
   <line>During the days,
he was hustling at his jobs,</line>
   <line>nights he was over at Drexel
taking classes.</line>
   <line>Folks he worked for liked him,</line>
   <line>but Matt knew he needed his B.A.</line>
   <line>Sounds like your son really stepped up.</line>
   <line>After that trouble he
and Blaine got into.</line>
   <line>A footnote in our file mentions
the food mart robbery.</line>
   <line>It wasn't a footnote to us.</line>
   <line>Matt had some... very bad years.</line>
   <line>First, he was stealing
money off my dresser,</line>
   <line>then breaking into the neighbor's house.</line>
   <line>I'm glad he robbed that store.</line>
   <line>He became a different
person after that.</line>
   <line>Scared straight.</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>That didn't straighten him out.</line>
   <line>He straightened himself out.</line>
   <line>There's a difference.</line>
   <line>That kid...</line>
   <line>He had what it takes.</line>
   <line>He had it.</line>
   <line>Well, the next three years,</line>
   <line>Matt was the boy we'd always
dreamed we'd have.</line>
   <line>And what about Blaine?</line>
   <line>Blaine's still over in Atlantic City.</line>
   <line>You the guys from Philly?</line>
   <line>Blaine Robbins.</line>
   <line>Detectives Rush and Valens.</line>
   <line>Hey.</line>
   <line>Gotta admit, um...
I'm not that glad to see you guys.</line>
   <line>Dragging up Matty's ghost
has me feeling kind of funky.</line>
   <line>Don't you want his m*rder solved?
- Definitely.</line>
   <line>Look, he missed his bus.</line>
   <line>I told him stay, but
he had to be at work.</line>
   <line>I would've given him a
ride myself, but no wheels.</line>
   <line>Well, you remember anyone watching Matt
that night, haning around him?</line>
   <line>Well, I wasn't with him at the time,</line>
   <line>but Matt is a... was....
a real approachable guy.</line>
   <line>Let's talk about that robbery
you and Matt did.</line>
   <line>Those were our bad years.</line>
   <line>We were kids.</line>
   <line>Kids who needed a thousand bucks.</line>
   <line>A thousand bucks for what?</line>
   <line>Start a vending machine business.</line>
   <line>What, like a Coke machine?</line>
   <line>Candy bars.</line>
   <line>There was a machine for sale
for $ , .</line>
   <line>And the idea was,
after we stocked it,</line>
   <line>Matt and I could clear $</line>
   <line>a week!</line>
   <line>Young guys, thinking big.</line>
   <line>Yeah... Yeah.</line>
   <line>Anything else about that night?</line>
   <line>No, I...
I was kind of hammered.</line>
   <line>Been celerbrating all night.</line>
   <line>Celebrating what?</line>
   <line>Matty had become a real entrepreneur.</line>
   <line>This rockin' investment opportunity
had just come our way...</line>
   <line>So this Click Twice
stock is a sure thing?</line>
   <line>For us to get in on an IPO,</line>
   <line>the broker would be doing us
a major favor.</line>
   <line>And that would get us in
on the ground floor,</line>
   <line>right where you wanna be.</line>
   <line>The stock'll sh**t right up,
that's why everyone wants in.</line>
   <line>But then it'll re-set,
find its real value.</line>
   <line>But, by that time,
you and me have already cashed out.</line>
   <line>Millionaires by age .</line>
   <line>We would've made out like bandits.</line>
   <line>But...</line>
   <line>without Matty, the deal...
went up in smoke.</line>
   <line>How's our list doing?</line>
   <line>Getting shorter.</line>
   <line>Two guys were in jail in ' ,</line>
   <line>three others have good,
substantiated whereabouts</line>
   <line>at the time of Matt's m*rder.</line>
   <line>So that leaves two.</line>
   <line>One.</line>
   <line>Oh. Meet Sam Royal,
Delaware State Police.</line>
   <line>How's it going?
- Okay.</line>
   <line>Down to one, huh? / Yeah.</line>
   <line>My suspect number
two was in a hospital</line>
   <line>in Bridgeport having dialysis
the night Matt was k*lled.</line>
   <line>So who's that leave?</line>
   <line>Henry Floyd.</line>
   <line>Truck dirver with a three-page sheet.</line>
   <line>He's a convicted thief,
con artist, attempted r*pist...</line>
   <line>Sounds like you know him pretty good.</line>
   <line>Yeah. I interviewed him.
He's got ice water in his veins.</line>
   <line>And a size ten shoe.</line>
   <line>g*ns?</line>
   <line>Got three registered hand g*ns,
including a . Smith and Wesson.</line>
   <line>Oh, and, uh... Mac
withdrawls puts Floyd</line>
   <line>in the AC casinos the night
before each of the murders.</line>
   <line>Gas receipts also put him
near the crime scenes.</line>
   <line>I'm liking Floyd more and more.</line>
   <line>Oh, when I asked him about these kids,</line>
   <line>the cocky S.O.B. smiles at me
and tells me</line>
   <line>he never picks up hitchhikers.</line>
   <line>What was cocky about that?</line>
   <line>I never mentioned hitchhikers.</line>
   <line>I wanna meet this guy.</line>
   <line>I got copies of his logs,
he's due back tomorrow.</line>
   <line>Where's he stay in Philly?</line>
   <line>Uh, he's got ties
to a woman out in Bristol.</line>
   <line>What's the tie?
- Girlfriend.</line>
   <line>Name's Janice Burns.</line>
   <line>Yep...</line>
   <line>I'm the girlfriend.</line>
   <line>That always sounds so silly.
- Why is that?</line>
   <line>I look like a girly-girl to you,
Hot Stuff?</line>
   <line>Besides, um... I wouldn't exactly...</line>
   <line>consider what we got
a traditional situation.</line>
   <line>What do you have?</line>
   <line>Henry comes here for one thing.</line>
   <line>Two, if he decides to stay
and eat up all my food.</line>
   <line>That doesn't sound like
you get much out of this.</line>
   <line>Why you let him in?</line>
   <line>Because if I don't,
he'll get his tool box</line>
   <line>and he'll take the door off the hinges.</line>
   <line>He's done it before.</line>
   <line>Who knew you'd be better off
leaving your door unlocked.</line>
   <line>Janice, you never called
the police, filed charges?</line>
   <line>Nope.
- Why not?</line>
   <line>I know what he'd do to me.</line>
   <line>Look, I made my bed.</line>
   <line>The only reason I met Henry</line>
   <line>was I was at the truck stops
looking for dates.</line>
   <line>And now that animal's been
in my life for ten years.</line>
   <line>I knew what I was doing was risky.</line>
   <line>So, tomorrow is just another day?</line>
   <line>What's tomorrow?</line>
   <line>Henry's coming to town.</line>
   <line>I didn't know that.</line>
   <line>He hasn't called you?</line>
   <line>Like I said, I leave the door open.</line>
   <line>Damn it.</line>
   <line>Ah, don't worry about it.</line>
   <line>Janice, you say Henry's been trampling
in and out of here the last ten years?</line>
   <line>That's right.</line>
   <line>And how long have you had this gray carpet?</line>
   <line>Hey, lab going to do a rush job
on that fiber?</line>
   <line>We'll have the results
by the end of the day.</line>
   <line>You check on Floyd?</line>
   <line>On schedule. Should arrive
at Muncy's Meats by noon.</line>
   <line>It'll take him at least another
minutes to get out to Janice's.</line>
   <line>We'll go early and wait for him.
- Royal's already on his way over.</line>
   <line>He's got it bad for this guy?</line>
   <line>Got a few hours.
Wanna take a ride, see my old Sergeant.</line>
   <line>He called back.</line>
   <line>He remembers the arrest?</line>
   <line>Just says he's in the office.
We should swing by.</line>
   <line>Scotty Valens.</line>
   <line>How's Homicide treating you?</line>
   <line>Ain't all bad.
How's things here?</line>
   <line>Good and quiet with you gone.</line>
   <line>Manny, this is
my new partner, Lilly Rush.</line>
   <line>Nice to meet you.</line>
   <line>Same here.</line>
   <line>Here's that DC number on that
arrest I was talking about.</line>
   <line>Two kids robbing a food mart, right?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Let me grab the ...</line>
   <line>Cousins.</line>
   <line>One of the kids, Matt Mills,
ended up dead.</line>
   <line>Matt was younger of the two.</line>
   <line>Him mom said getting locked up
scared Matt pretty good.</line>
   <line>I don't know if it was so much
about being locked up</line>
   <line>as it was that Russian
reading him the riot act.</line>
   <line>The Russian is the store owner?</line>
   <line>Yeah. Ivan Medvedenko.</line>
   <line>Made a scene out here
you wouldn't forget too easy.</line>
   <line>so I took the phone, dialed .</line>
   <line>I should've ran after them.</line>
   <line>No, calling was the right thing.</line>
   <line>That is one, right there.</line>
   <line>You!</line>
   <line>You stole from me!</line>
   <line>Shame on you.
Your dirty hands.</line>
   <line>Lazy, American boy.</line>
   <line>Calm down, Ivan.</line>
   <line>How old are you?</line>
   <line>Seventeen.</line>
   <line>Too late.</line>
   <line>Too late for what?</line>
   <line>Change.</line>
   <line>You'll always be spoiled.</line>
   <line>Die!</line>
   <line>Just, die.</line>
   <line>A boy like you no one will miss.</line>
   <line>Johnny, take this man downstairs.</line>
   <line>Russian tells Matt to die.</line>
   <line>Anything behind those words?</line>
   <line>First detectives on that kid's
m*rder came asking the same,</line>
   <line>but Medvedenko had no record.</line>
   <line>Wonder if Matt and Blaine
ever want back to his store.</line>
   <line>If they were dumb enough to do that,
then I'd say all bets were off.</line>
   <line>Sorry.</line>
   <line>Rush.</line>
   <line>Working with a girl, huh.
- Yeah.</line>
   <line>She a political case?</line>
   <line>Nah, she came from North.</line>
   <line>Did real good there.</line>
   <line>Floyd just got to town.</line>
   <line>Gotta go. Thanks, Manny.</line>
   <line>Henry Floyd?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Philadelphia Police.</line>
   <line>Sit down, Henry.</line>
   <line>Get you some coffee?</line>
   <line>Sure you can't offer me more
than that, sweet tits?</line>
   <line>Oh... you and me are gonna
some problems, Henry.</line>
   <line>It's okay, Scotty.</line>
   <line>You wanna do me, huh?</line>
   <line>I'm not sure yet.</line>
   <line>Twirl around once.</line>
   <line>Scotty, give me and Henry
some private time.</line>
   <line>You've been naughty, Henry.</line>
   <line>Three murders along your truck route.</line>
   <line>So?</line>
   <line>We've been charting where you've been
and what you've done,</line>
   <line>and not just us.</line>
   <line>Jersey and Delaware cops are
on your a*s, too.</line>
   <line>Am I under arrest?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>You're free to go.</line>
   <line>Want to?</line>
   <line>No, I'm enjoying myself.</line>
   <line>We have copies of your trucking logs,
credit card receipts,</line>
   <line>day-to-day map of your whereabouts.</line>
   <line>Dolly, none of that means
nothing and you know it.</line>
   <line>Actually, one good piece of
physical evidence</line>
   <line>can mean everything.</line>
   <line>And we have fibers, Floyd.</line>
   <line>from Janice's carpet.</line>
   <line>Oh, you've seen Janice?</line>
   <line>So you know what an upgrade you'd be.</line>
   <line>Three m*rder trials in three states.</line>
   <line>Anyway you look at it,</line>
   <line>you'll get the needle.</line>
   <line>Matt Mills.</line>
   <line>You ended his life for $ , .</line>
   <line>You ever think on that?
- I don't get your meaning.</line>
   <line>Well, what's the lowest you'd
end someone's life for?</line>
   <line>a Swiss Army Knife?</line>
   <line>Dolly, you and me...</line>
   <line>we don't see the world the same way.</line>
   <line>Oh, you're a Philosopher.</line>
   <line>So that gives you the right
to take someone's life away?</line>
   <line>You're putting words in my mouth.</line>
   <line>I didn't k*ll him, didn't k*ll anyone.</line>
   <line>Then take a polygraph for me.</line>
   <line>Okay.</line>
   <line>Did you m*rder Matt Mills?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>Did you k*ll Chuck Praska?</line>
   <line>Chuck get iced in Jersey or Delaware?</line>
   <line>Yes or no answers, Floyd.</line>
   <line>Roger that.</line>
   <line>Did you m*rder Chuck Praska?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>Did you m*rder Brian Fritz?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>The next question
I want you to answer incorrectly.</line>
   <line>The purpose is to intentionally
make the chart spike.</line>
   <line>Is this card the ace of spades?</line>
   <line>Yes.</line>
   <line>He never spiked.</line>
   <line>not even when he lied about the card.</line>
   <line>He beat the polygraph.</line>
   <line>But good.</line>
   <line>You know, you never should have
gone to see Janice.</line>
   <line>Now s perfectly good ten-year
relationship will have to end.</line>
   <line>You gonna k*ll her, too, Henry?</line>
   <line>Like those three kids?</line>
   <line>You're putting words
in my mouth again.</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>What are you looking at?</line>
   <line>A dead man.</line>
   <line>And get those feet off my table.</line>
   <line>The ball on Floyd's left
boot is severely worn down,</line>
   <line>probably from pressing down
on the clutch when he's in his rig.</line>
   <line>First time around,</line>
   <line>criminalistics looked at
the brand, size, and tread.</line>
   <line>Maybe they never looked at
the ball of the foot.</line>
   <line>So let's pull the molds from evidence,
re-submit them to the lab.</line>
   <line>You wanna that Jersey know?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Hey.
- See you.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Lot of wear and tear
on Floyd's left hoof.</line>
   <line>If the plaster molds
match, we got him.</line>
   <line>Good. 'Cause the fiber match
didn't happen.</line>
   <line>Crap.
- Inconclusive.</line>
   <line>But I got something else.</line>
   <line>Yeah, what?</line>
   <line>Manny called back.</line>
   <line>He ran that store owner
through the computer again.</line>
   <line>Starting ' , he does have a sheet.</line>
   <line>For what?</line>
   <line>Arrested for assaulting one of
his customers.</line>
   <line>Then five months ago...</line>
   <line>chased a shoplifter with a revolver.</line>
   <line>Fired six sh*ts.</line>
   <line>What kind of revolver?</line>
   <line>. Special.</line>
   <line>Just like the one that k*lled Matt.</line>
   <line>Better go have a conversation.</line>
   <line>Philadelphia Homicide.</line>
   <line>We wanna ask you some question.</line>
   <line>I haven't done anything.</line>
   <line>We're investigating the m*rder
of a young man you had history with.</line>
   <line>Recognize him?</line>
   <line>You know who that boy is, don't you?</line>
   <line>He robbed me.</line>
   <line>Him and the other.</line>
   <line>Held you at gunpoint, right?</line>
   <line>Like animals.</line>
   <line>Thanks.</line>
   <line>Hey.</line>
   <line>What are you doing there?</line>
   <line>Sorry, pops.</line>
   <line>Hey!</line>
   <line>Get away.</line>
   <line>If you don't get away,
I'll call the police.</line>
   <line>Get away, I said!</line>
   <line>Hey!</line>
   <line>Thief!</line>
   <line>Don't move!
- Thief!</line>
   <line>Don't move! Don't move!</line>
   <line>Matty, hurry!</line>
   <line>Don't move!</line>
   <line>You shouldn't have chased me out.
Why you gotta make things complicated?</line>
   <line>Matty, hurry!</line>
   <line>Let's go!</line>
   <line>They never saw Pejia,</line>
   <line>my son,</line>
   <line>and for that... I am thankful.</line>
   <line>But you must've held a grudge.</line>
   <line>What's your meaning?</line>
   <line>Those boys got arrested
but only got probation.</line>
   <line>Did that get you mad, Ivan?
- They should've gone to jail.</line>
   <line>And since they didn't, maybe you
decided to do something about it.</line>
   <line>Aah, three years later?</line>
   <line>You remember how many years later
Matt got k*lled?</line>
   <line>You heard that kid got m*rder*d, huh?</line>
   <line>Yeah. Everyone talked about it.</line>
   <line>You recall where you
were the day he died?</line>
   <line>Here. Working, like always.
- Can you prove it?</line>
   <line>I leave people alone.</line>
   <line>I've never hurt anyone.</line>
   <line>Oh, you leave people alone</line>
   <line>outside of when you sh**t your g*n
off at them, is that it?</line>
   <line>I don't have a g*n.</line>
   <line>Medvedenko, we're cops.</line>
   <line>We know about you firing sh*ts
at the shoplifter.</line>
   <line>The neighbors told police
you had a . Special.</line>
   <line>No g*n was found. Go on, check.</line>
   <line>That's 'cause you got rid of it.</line>
   <line>Please, leave my store.</line>
   <line>You wanna tell us about
the g*n, otherwise</line>
   <line>you look suspicious, Ivan.</line>
   <line>I sold it.</line>
   <line>To who? / Back to whom
I bought if from Mr. Joey.</line>
   <line>Mr. Joey?</line>
   <line>You saying Joey's, his last name?</line>
   <line>I don't know.</line>
   <line>He just has hot g*ns.</line>
   <line>At his pawn store.</line>
   <line>You'll never find it.</line>
   <line>I wanna find Mr.Joey.
Follow that g*n.</line>
   <line>Molds came back.
- The ball on the left foot?</line>
   <line>Worn down.</line>
   <line>Perfect match...</line>
   <line>for Jersey and Delaware.</line>
   <line>What about our job?</line>
   <line>So, Floyd didn't k*ll Matt.</line>
   <line>But it absolutely puts him away
for the other two hitchhiker jobs,</line>
   <line>I can't thank you enough.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Anytime.</line>
   <line>Floyd'll go down to holding
until Jersey can get here.</line>
   <line>You can fight over him down there.</line>
   <line>Thanks, Philly.</line>
   <line>I couldn't have done it without you.</line>
   <line>So, you just solved two murders.</line>
   <line>That's pretty decent.
- We didn't solve our m*rder.</line>
   <line>Matt's our job.</line>
   <line>Lil...</line>
   <line>Matt's sister.</line>
   <line>Hi, Katie.</line>
   <line>Hi. Is it okay I'm here?</line>
   <line>Sure. Your parents with you?
- No. I got the address off your card.</line>
   <line>Uh, I'm gonna go find Mr. Joey.</line>
   <line>What can I do for you?</line>
   <line>I wanted to know about Matty.</line>
   <line>Cause no one tells me,</line>
   <line>and... I mean, I miss him, too.</line>
   <line>What do you wanna know?</line>
   <line>Do you know who k*lled him?</line>
   <line>Not yet.</line>
   <line>Blaine said a serial k*ller.</line>
   <line>You're close to Blaine, huh?</line>
   <line>He tells me things,
not like my parents.</line>
   <line>Well, your parents probably
just wanna keep you young,</line>
   <line>Katie, as long as possible.</line>
   <line>Matt treated me like a grown-up.</line>
   <line>Blaine's just like him.</line>
   <line>Real nice,</line>
   <line>really, really smart.</line>
   <line>Smart, huh? / He knows how
to do all kinds of stuff.</line>
   <line>He can fly a plane.</line>
   <line>Blaine's a pilot?
- He has his license.</line>
   <line>And later this year,
he's starting a restaurant.</line>
   <line>Really.</line>
   <line>Well, a nightclub kind of place.</line>
   <line>I got some seed money
saved up to invest.</line>
   <line>Sounds like you got business
in your blood, Katie.</line>
   <line>Like Matty did.</line>
   <line>He called me that night.</line>
   <line>Matt did?</line>
   <line>Before he died.</line>
   <line>I'm coming home tomorrow, okay?</line>
   <line>You made a lot of money?</line>
   <line>Yup.</line>
   <line>So you'll buy me something?</line>
   <line>I already did.
- What?</line>
   <line>Sand dollars.</line>
   <line>What else did you do there?</line>
   <line>I ran into somebody I knew.</line>
   <line>Sort of got into a fight with him.</line>
   <line>It brought up some bad feelings.</line>
   <line>Matty?</line>
   <line>Yeah?</line>
   <line>Besides the sand dollars,
could you bring taffy, too?</line>
   <line>Sure. Taffy, too.</line>
   <line>I was only ten.</line>
   <line>I didn't think about what he said.</line>
   <line>I understand.</line>
   <line>But now I'm thinking that maybe</line>
   <line>it mattered that he ran into someone.</line>
   <line>It might.</line>
   <line>Thanks for telling me now.</line>
   <line>He first came by after
them two kids robbed him.</line>
   <line>Said he had to have a g*n.</line>
   <line>You gave him the . .</line>
   <line>Then all was quiet for, like, years</line>
   <line>till he ran wild on that shoplifter.</line>
   <line>After that craziness, he came back,
wanting to move that g*n real quick.</line>
   <line>I need to get that g*n, Jeoy.
Where is it now?</line>
   <line>I only had it another week.</line>
   <line>It went back out hot?</line>
   <line>Nah. I'm riding on the boulevard,
minding my own business.</line>
   <line>These bozos on patrol pulled me over.</line>
   <line>I wonder why.</line>
   <line>The bastard said I ran a light.</line>
   <line>Next thing you know,
they're confiscating</line>
   <line>that . out of my glove box,</line>
   <line>and I'm on my way back to court.</line>
   <line>What did the Judge say?</line>
   <line>Ordered that g*n destroyed.</line>
   <line>Wasn't such a loss.</line>
   <line>I might've had a body on it anyway.</line>
   <line>How well you know this Ivan Medvedenko?</line>
   <line>Well enough to stay out of his way.</line>
   <line>What's his deal?</line>
   <line>When he first came to the neighborhood,
he was actually kind of nice.</line>
   <line>Had this idea America was gonna
treat him and his kid right.</line>
   <line>Didn't work out that way?</line>
   <line>He hated all them lowlifes
hanging around,</line>
   <line>homeless trying to get
free stuff from him.</line>
   <line>When he came asking for that g*n,</line>
   <line>talking about lazy
kids needing a lesson,</line>
   <line>he had some... glint in his eye.</line>
   <line>Kind of scared me.</line>
   <line>Morning.
- Hi.</line>
   <line>Over losing Floyd?</line>
   <line>All about Medvedenko now.
- What changed?</line>
   <line>I've been trying to connect Medvedenko</line>
   <line>to Atlantic City the weekend
Matt was k*lled.</line>
   <line>And?</line>
   <line>Guess who won a Center City Bank
sweepstakes, June of ' ?</line>
   <line>Medvedenko.
- His wife.</line>
   <line>Prize was a free gambling
junket in Atlantic City,</line>
   <line>trip for two.</line>
   <line>Medvedenko said he was working.</line>
   <line>Guess he wasn't working.
- Oh, it's gonna be a good day for us.</line>
   <line>Bad one for Medvedenko.</line>
   <line>You lied to me, Ivan.</line>
   <line>I had to.</line>
   <line>I knew you'd bring me in.</line>
   <line>That you'd suspect me.</line>
   <line>Those are some good instincts.</line>
   <line>I'm innocent.</line>
   <line>When did you come to this country, Ivan?</line>
   <line>dark times in Russia.</line>
   <line>Walk lightly.</line>
   <line>Very lightly.</line>
   <line>Must have felt good to finally
get to America.</line>
   <line>Since I was a boy, it was my dream...</line>
   <line>to work...</line>
   <line>make your own life.</line>
   <line>What a gift.</line>
   <line>Then one day, two
good-for-nothing boys,</line>
   <line>who didn't think much of that
gift, came and robbed you.</line>
   <line>I didn't k*ll that boy.</line>
   <line>Take a seat.</line>
   <line>Don't lie to me.</line>
   <line>You were in Atlantic City,
so was Matt Mills.</line>
   <line>Okay.</line>
   <line>Yes.
- Yes, what?</line>
   <line>Yes, I saw him in Atlantic City.</line>
   <line>I saw him, did not k*ll him!</line>
   <line>Remember me?</line>
   <line>I-I-I don't want any trouble.</line>
   <line>You don't want trouble?</line>
   <line>I didn't want trouble either.</line>
   <line>My son, Pejia.</line>
   <line>You don't remember him.</line>
   <line>But he was there when you robbed me.</line>
   <line>He saw!</line>
   <line>Sir, I regret what we did,</line>
   <line>an-and I heard what you said to me.</line>
   <line>I tell Pejia if he works hard,</line>
   <line>he can be anything he wants.</line>
   <line>But he says, "Dad,</line>
   <line>why work hard when people
can just take your money?"</line>
   <line>You did that.</line>
   <line>Sir...</line>
   <line>all I can do is say I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>Please...</line>
   <line>Did you shake his hands?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>Because sorry wasn't good enough.</line>
   <line>And who would miss this kid anyway?</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>If he died, who would
miss a boy like him?</line>
   <line>Remember saying that?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>There he goes,</line>
   <line>lying to me again.</line>
   <line>You already lied to me about the g*n.</line>
   <line>You lied about leaving people alone.</line>
   <line>Lied about your whereabouts
the day of the m*rder.</line>
   <line>I mean, who do you think
you're lying to, Ivan?</line>
   <line>I'm the police.</line>
   <line>You got that?</line>
   <line>Yes.
- Are you sure?</line>
   <line>Because you wanna see your son again,</line>
   <line>I'd better start hearing some I believe.</line>
   <line>Please.</line>
   <line>You're going away, Medvedenko.</line>
   <line>I'll disappear?</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>You'll make me disappear?</line>
   <line>Or Pejia?
- Hey, you're damn right.</line>
   <line>You wanna keep lying, Medvedenko?</line>
   <line>Poof! Now start talking about
how you k*lled Matt Mills.</line>
   <line>I have to see my son again.
- Tell me about the . you got from Joey.</line>
   <line>How you took Matt in your car</line>
   <line>and marched that kid into the woods</line>
   <line>but don't you lie!</line>
   <line>I hate a liar!</line>
   <line>Yes.</line>
   <line>Yes, what?</line>
   <line>I did it.</line>
   <line>I k*lled him.</line>
   <line>You want me to feel sorry for you?</line>
   <line>You m*rder*d a kid.</line>
   <line>I'll write what you want.
- I write, you talk.</line>
   <line>It's got to be first person.</line>
   <line>The other one deserved death.</line>
   <line>What other one? Blaine?
- He put the g*n to my head.</line>
   <line>He was there that night, too, Ivan.</line>
   <line>You could've had a twofer.</line>
   <line>I saw him outside the casino,</line>
   <line>I could say anything.</line>
   <line>He went.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>I'll notify Matt's family, his cousin...</line>
   <line>I don't know, Scotty.</line>
   <line>Don't know what?</line>
   <line>Blaine told us he would've given
Matt a ride home,</line>
   <line>but he didn't have wheels.</line>
   <line>But Medvedenko said he saw
Blaine driving away in a car.</line>
   <line>So, Medvedenko's lying.</line>
   <line>Maybe, but you should check it out.</line>
   <line>We did. DMV shows Blaine
didn't own a car in ' .</line>
   <line>But AutoTrack just gave me
a secondary address</line>
   <line>on Blaine for all of ' .</line>
   <line>A magazine subscription
was sent to his workplace.</line>
   <line>What workplace?</line>
   <line>Roll-The-Dice Rentals.</line>
   <line>A rent-a-car company.</line>
   <line>Would have given Blaine
access to a car.</line>
   <line>Medvedenko just confessed.</line>
   <line>I mean, why would he go
if he didn't do it?</line>
   <line>Because you got him wetting his pants.</line>
   <line>You figured out where he lives,
and you went there.</line>
   <line>Ain't that our job?</line>
   <line>Scotty, you ask a guy like that</line>
   <line>again, maybe he thinks KGB.</line>
   <line>Maybe he thinks you're saying
you're gonna k*ll his kid.</line>
   <line>Make him disappear.</line>
   <line>That was a good interview.</line>
   <line>Let's make sure of that.</line>
   <line>We got a lot of power in that room.</line>
   <line>No good deed goes unpunished, I guess.</line>
   <line>It's one more trip to Atlantic City.
We can afford that, can't we?</line>
   <line>Before we put away father of
an -year-old forever?</line>
   <line>That's gonna be one fun
ride, I'll tell you that.</line>
   <line>We can't get a car for another hour.</line>
   <line>Okay. / It's pretty pathethic.</line>
   <line>The department don't get
enough cars to go around.</line>
   <line>You're just now noticing
our crap resources?</line>
   <line>Don't take a tone.</line>
   <line>I was just about to say that to you.</line>
   <line>Just hung up with
the Atlantic City Flying Club.</line>
   <line>Blaine shelled out $ ,
in October ' .</line>
   <line>Exact amount stolen off of Matt.</line>
   <line>Four months after he died.</line>
   <line>Case was cold by then.</line>
   <line>We know Blaine didn't
have a lot of cash flow.</line>
   <line>all at once is significant.</line>
   <line>Yeah, but do you k*ll your buddy
just so you can take flying lessons?</line>
   <line>This wasn't for recreation.
He was gonna start a business.</line>
   <line>Another business?</line>
   <line>The plan was to buy a Cessna
and go into aerial advertising.</line>
   <line>Like one of them planes with the
banner flying over Eagle games?</line>
   <line>Yeah, for "Ted's TV and Stereo",
whatever.</line>
   <line>So, what happened?</line>
   <line>The $ , got him through
instruction, not to his license.</line>
   <line>Blaine never became a pilot.
- Another brainstorm down the drain.</line>
   <line>But he didn't k*ll Matt for the money.</line>
   <line>What's his motive?</line>
   <line>They hadn't seen each other in a while.
Maybe they grew apart.</line>
   <line>We know Matt changed.</line>
   <line>Blaine's looking like the
mope he's always been.</line>
   <line>Could rub a guy the wrong way if your
prodigy grows up different than you did.</line>
   <line>Especially if that kid looked up
to you the way Katie does now.</line>
   <line>Let's go see about that car.</line>
   <line>If Blaine took a car out that day,
I don't have the paperwork.</line>
   <line>What about mileage that's not
accounted for? You track that?</line>
   <line>Give me a second.</line>
   <line>Of course, all this tells me</line>
   <line>is if a car went out on
such and such a day,</line>
   <line>Understood.</line>
   <line>Okay, here's something.</line>
   <line>One vehicle does show
some missing miles.</line>
   <line>miles on a Honda Accord.</line>
   <line>About the round-trip distance
between here and the crime scene.</line>
   <line>Sure glad I fired that kid.</line>
   <line>Why did you fire Blaine?</line>
   <line>One morning he showed up with a g*n.</line>
   <line>I saw it in his duffel bag.</line>
   <line>What'd you do about it?</line>
   <line>I took the g*n,
I turned it into the cops.</line>
   <line>You're a tough guy to find, Blaine.</line>
   <line>I've been upstairs.</line>
   <line>Got on a bit of a streak this morning.</line>
   <line>The house comped me a room.</line>
   <line>Come on, number two.</line>
   <line>Come on, two horse.</line>
   <line>Even a permanent address,
I couldn't find one.</line>
   <line>I don't got one right now.</line>
   <line>Where were you living last?
- With some chick. It's a long story.</line>
   <line>Been there.</line>
   <line>Yeah. Drink?</line>
   <line>Em..Thanks.</line>
   <line>Uh, what you're having.</line>
   <line>Come on.</line>
   <line>Come on, two, two, two, two...</line>
   <line>Damn it!</line>
   <line>We talked to your cousin Katie
the other day, Blaine.</line>
   <line>Yeah? I love that kid.
Smart, you know?</line>
   <line>Funny, she said that about you.</line>
   <line>Yeah?</line>
   <line>Told me about the nightclub, bar
restaurant thing, you're getting started.</line>
   <line>Sounds like a hot move.</line>
   <line>Could' been big,</line>
   <line>but some backers just dropped out.</line>
   <line>Deal fell through.</line>
   <line>Same old, same old, right?</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>You just seem to run into that a lot.</line>
   <line>You know, this restaurant deal,</line>
   <line>and that airplane venture before that.</line>
   <line>Candy bar machine.</line>
   <line>Why you taking sh*ts?</line>
   <line>Those aren't sh*ts.</line>
   <line>Part of me feels for you, Blaine.</line>
   <line>When a someone's bad at
what they want to be good at,</line>
   <line>that's not easy to deal with.</line>
   <line>We know about Roll-the-Dice
Rentals, Blaine.</line>
   <line>How you took the car out that day.</line>
   <line>There's no record of that.</line>
   <line>There's a record of the mileage.</line>
   <line>Probably didn't think
it through that far, huh?</line>
   <line>Didn't cover your tracks
with that g*n too good, either.</line>
   <line>Bringing it to work.</line>
   <line>Now A.C. police have it inventoried.</line>
   <line>And spending Matt's three
grand at the flying school...</line>
   <line>Kind of a half-baked
plan, huh, Blaine?</line>
   <line>Kind of a familiar theme for you.</line>
   <line>I'm good at business.</line>
   <line>Matt was the one working for
a brokerage house,</line>
   <line>making connections.</line>
   <line>I taught Matt.</line>
   <line>A -year-old with enough
moxie to get in on an IPO.</line>
   <line>You said you were happy
about that, but maybe it hurt.</line>
   <line>Matt being the guy who was
the one making things happen.</line>
   <line>I made that happen!</line>
   <line>The IPO was my idea.
The whole damn things.</line>
   <line>Millionaires by age .</line>
   <line>Salud.</line>
   <line>Blaine, put the drink down.</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>In theory, everything you're
saying is great.</line>
   <line>Now let's talk specifics.</line>
   <line>Yeah, yeah, let's talk.</line>
   <line>Who are the principals behind this?</line>
   <line>These McSorley Brothers.</line>
   <line>It's their dot com.</line>
   <line>And who's underwriting?</line>
   <line>Uh...</line>
   <line>I don't know.</line>
   <line>Well, you'd want to find that out.</line>
   <line>Look, Ronnie Mack says
we got to jump on this.</line>
   <line>Blaine, IPO's are all based on hype.</line>
   <line>You can't just go on what</line>
   <line>this pit boss buddy of
yours is telling you.</line>
   <line>When I get back to the office</line>
   <line>I'll see what an analyst thinks.</line>
   <line>Ship's gonna sail.</line>
   <line>We gotta pull the trigger on
this day after next.</line>
   <line>Then why we having this conversation?</line>
   <line>You said we needed grand to get in.</line>
   <line>Where are we gonna get grand?</line>
   <line>A casino.</line>
   <line>A casino?</line>
   <line>I've been casing this place.</line>
   <line>Here we go.</line>
   <line>What are you doing?
Cover that.</line>
   <line>They got an open cage here.</line>
   <line>We're in and out in seconds.</line>
   <line>Are you crazy?</line>
   <line>Watch how you're talking to me.</line>
   <line>Blaine, you gotta wake up.</line>
   <line>Always with the pipe dream.</line>
   <line>It's getting stupid.
- Blah, blah, blah.</line>
   <line>Forget you, pal.</line>
   <line>I'm doing this one myself.</line>
   <line>I'm not gonna let you.</line>
   <line>You're not gonna let me?</line>
   <line>I'll walk over to the cage right now.</line>
   <line>Tip'em off.</line>
   <line>Listen, he don't wanna go along?</line>
   <line>Fine.</line>
   <line>But saying he's gonna stop me?</line>
   <line>For my own good?</line>
   <line>That runt used to wear
my hand-me-downs!</line>
   <line>Now he's gonna big-man me like that?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>All right.</line>
   <line>Come on. Get in.</line>
   <line>Don't you stop. I swear, Matty,
I blow your head off.</line>
   <line>All right. All right.</line>
   <line>Go to that tree.</line>
   <line>Okay.</line>
   <line>Turn around.</line>
   <line>Listen, Blaine, you're gonna rob me?</line>
   <line>Take the three grand from the tables.
You can have it.</line>
   <line>Shut the hell up.</line>
   <line>I'm talking now.</line>
   <line>You've known me longer than anybody.</line>
   <line>Why did you look at me like that?</line>
   <line>Like what?</line>
   <line>You're still doing it.</line>
   <line>Put your head down.
I don't wanna see your face.</line>
   <line>Do it!</line>
   <line>Nothing's changed, Matty!</line>
   <line>Suddenly, you're looking at me like
you don't know what the hell I'm doing?</line>
   <line>All I need is a break.</line>
   <line>One break and I'm on my way.</line>
   <line>You've always known that</line>
   <line>since we were kids.</line>
   <line>You were the only one.</line>
   <line>Blaine...
- Shut up!</line>
   <line>There's nothing for you to say.</line>
   <line>I wanna see it...</line>
   <line>in your eyes.</line>
   <line>Matty, I need one thing to go my way.</line>
   <line>And no one's gonna tell me different.</line>
   <line>Now you look up at me,</line>
   <line>and you show me you still know that.</line>
   <line>Just one break...</line>
