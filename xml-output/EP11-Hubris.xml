   <line type="dialogue">May ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detective Rush, cold jobs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, Roy Minard,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">uh, Fallen from Grace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're looking at a
ruined man, I'm afraid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wanna sit down?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thank you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was a, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was a professor at the University,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">enjoying a quiet life
of arts and sciences</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when I became embroiled
in a m*rder case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My unfortunate role was as
the number one suspect.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who had the unfortunate
role of victim?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly Richardson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was one of my students.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Very promising young mind.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">k*lled on Campus?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nine years ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whipped and strangled
with a car antenna.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Awful.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, there must have been a
reason you were investigated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And one reason only.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly and I were having an affair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which I lied about at the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why does a philanderer lie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was married.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ashamed of my behavior.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Covering your tracks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And my dishonesty on that matter</line>
   <line type="dialogue">was seen as guilty in this
far more serious charge.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The press went to town.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My wife and child left town...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and I was soon relieved of
my professorship</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and banned from campus.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you're here talking to me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so clearly you weren't
convicted of anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not in a court of law.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you're innocent, of course.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You've heard of Richard Jewell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He and I would have a lot to talk about.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So why come in today, Roy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, I found this</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in the newspaper.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A prost*tute in Norristown</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the Schuylkill two weeks ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Same as Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A lot of bodies are
dumped in the river.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, but this one was also k*lled</line>
   <line type="dialogue">with a car antenna.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw that and I, uh,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought maybe I've
found my one-armed man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now you're Richard Kimble.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If there is a connection,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">maybe you can solve two murders.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And save my life in the process.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly Richardson, .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">k*lled in West Philly, May ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">lashes with an antenna</line>
   <line type="dialogue">before he strangled her with it."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Little humiliation
before the grand finale.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dumped in the Schuylkill.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doer was probably trying
to wash away evidence.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They found semen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Professor Minard's?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yup.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So they did it the
night of the m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Outside of that, what do we got?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He and Holy were at
the same party at the...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Elizabethan Club.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Some people saw them having words.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Words."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I love how them Ivy Leaguers talk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They had a fight, okay, Dummy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So that's the whole case?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why'd this guy get the pinch?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He lied about the affair
till the DNA came back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then he changed his story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How's the Norristown
m*rder come into play?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This hooker job had
a pretty similar M.O.,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the antenna, the river dump.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Worth getting a look
at that Norristown file.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vera won't mind taking a ride.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This professor still
teaching Art History?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">English as a second language.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Step or two down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Paid a high price if he's innocent.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or if he's guilty,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he's gotten a lot of free years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, we reinvestigate him, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi, we meet again.
Excuse me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Professor Minard,
my partner Scotty Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi. Thank you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're very kind to
call me "professor",</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but around here I'm just "Mr. Roy."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So does this visit mean</line>
   <line type="dialogue">there was something to
my amateur detective's theory?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We don't know yet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've filled a lot of time the
last nine years</line>
   <line type="dialogue">reading mystery novels.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought maybe I was
getting carried away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, we haven't seen the
file from Norristown yet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But we were wondering where you were</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the uh, night that hooker got k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right, um...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I teach here nights,
Mondays through Thursday.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What night was she k*lled?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a Tuesday.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then I was here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">other witnesses
will tell you the same,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in broken but improving English.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lying about your affair with Holly</line>
   <line type="dialogue">got you in a lot of hot water.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was arrogant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bill Clinton lied to America
about the intern.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I lied to Philadelphia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you both got caught in the end.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't do it again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">DNA...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">will get you every time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So when Holly was k*lled,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">how were you two getting along?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, in my first statement,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I said things were great.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But to be honest,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">there was some tension.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I had a small dinner
party, would you come?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Small, as in you and me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe six people or eight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I wouldn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why not?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly... there are rules.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I wanna see you in public.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You can't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">God, don't you ever even think
about me outside this office?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure. Thinking is perfectly fair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Seeing each other outside
of these four walls...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">it's not possible.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What if I don't like
those rules anymore?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds like you laid
it out pretty clear.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My campus and my home life
stayed separate.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No contact outside of office hours.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that what you called it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not even phone calls.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here's the deal, Roy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If we're gonna look
at this case again,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you gotta be an open book this time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Done.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In fact...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here it is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What is it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's a list of women,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">who were also...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Conquests?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you offer these names</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in the first investigation?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I was pretending
Holly was the only one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They'll probably badmouth me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'll hear a lot about bad behavior,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but nothing that says "m*rder."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was sick in love with that jerk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I see you took two different art history
courses with him, spring of ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hm, 'cause I couldn't
get enough of him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know how vile it is
to know you were with a m*rder*r?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why do you think he's a m*rder*r?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I read the papers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He told City Magazine</line>
   <line type="dialogue">he didn't do anything
to "hurt that girl."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pretty strange word choice,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">don't you think?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was he ever violent with you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Possessive? Scary, at all?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you still think maybe
he could have whipped</line>
   <line type="dialogue">this Holly to death.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I read the papers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He toyed with me
my whole sophomore year.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Treated you bad?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like a piece of a*s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Seduced me with poetry and wine
during office hours...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if I saw him on campus.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think he m*rder*d Holly?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He got a lawyer pretty fast.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll tell you a secret, Monique,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that's actually the smart thing to do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Seems like the guilty
thing to do, to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Roy Minard...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't say that name
too loudly around here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We need to know about
your relationship with him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In ' ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm on the faculty now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It'd be bad for me if that got out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that why you kept it from
the police nine years ago?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was never asked.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, this isn't popular
opinion around campus,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but Roy didn't k*ll Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't think so?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was unethical but
he's not a m*rder*r.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't think he
was unethical in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't really get what an abuse</line>
   <line type="dialogue">it was until I started teaching.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's just so easy to impress students.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Roy's very charismatic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We've met him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you know Holly Richardson?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I tried to warn her not to
get in too deep with Roy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I talked to her that night
at the Elizabethan Club.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's not so easy seeing
them in the flesh, is it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?
- The wife, the kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, it's not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly, this time last year,
I was standing right where you are.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you feel like you'd
just been hit by a truck?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's happy with them.
He won't leave.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why does he have affairs
if he's so happy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know his psychology.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But there's a new girl every year.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And the year's almost over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think it's different this time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I felt for her.
I, I was her at one point.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But she was upset at him...
not the other way around.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So after two hours of making copies</line>
   <line type="dialogue">this Norristown job...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stillman told us
about the flat tire.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, that precinct's copier
was from the mimeograph era.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, guys, it was bad luck.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, well, we finish
up your dog call,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">traffic on Ridge Pike...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">prost*tute's name was Lenore Grandy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And bam!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And we were in the fast lane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vera, Jeffries thank you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You risked your very
lives for this job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, guys, can we talk about
Lenore Grandy now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whipped times with a car antenna,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">then strangled with it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And dumped in the Schuylkill.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's just like Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But here's the money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lonore... Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wow...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gotta be the same doer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How did no one catch this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Different counties.
Computer don't talk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Roy Minard have an alibi
for the second m*rder?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Teaching his class that
night. It checked out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he did get the Jewell treatment.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got something we can run with.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cross-referenced</line>
   <line type="dialogue">sweeps in Norristown</line>
   <line type="dialogue">with the university alumni records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two hits.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Clarence Grimes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Graduated years ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He wouldn't know Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, but Barry Tepler would.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was in school same time as her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He only lives eight blocks
from where Lenore was dumped.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't have... people over...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're here about Holly Richardson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't bring her up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why not?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I stay away from Holly,
just like she told me to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly told you stay away, Barry?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She invited me home for Thanksgiving...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I misinterpreted her
gesture of friendship</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for a deeper interest,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I changed my behavior
when she relayed her true feelings.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your therapist tell you that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or lawyer?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When she asked me to
leave her alone... I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What you doing here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I go to school here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you don't have any
classes in Williams Hall.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanted to see you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Barry, you're following me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I like you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not interested in you in that way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You took me to meet your parents.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was Thanksgiving.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You had nowhere else to go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, can we talk about it, or...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. Nope.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't wanna talk about it,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't want you to
call me or follow me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh-huh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I don't want any more letters.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those are yours.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, they're yours.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you stalked Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I pursued her with
too much enthusiasm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You still have those letters, Barry?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You save dental reminders
from three years ago,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but not those letters?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I... I was in my dorm room
when she was k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where were you
when Lenore Grandy was k*lled?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know who that is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A hooker.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">m*rder*d December th,
eight blocks from here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a Tuesday.
Tuesdays I paint.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have therapy at : ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">then I go to Wawa for a Red Bull,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">uh, get a Newsweek,
I'm home by : .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Plenty of time for
prost*tute on that schedule.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't use prostitutes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Risperdol.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got schizophrenia?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hear voices?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">God talking through the garbage?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm better now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's tough getting better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You stop, taking these, you
can fall into psychotic behavior.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I take'em.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, maybe you lapsed</line>
   <line type="dialogue">right around December th,
voices started saying</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you should hurt that hooker.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't go near those whores!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, he comes here all the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hangs around and tries to talk to us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He ever talk to your friend Lenore?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, he especially liked her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stared at her from across the street.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He the one k*lled her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, we don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I figured it was a bad John did it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This kid was never Lenore's trick?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm-mm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He walked up to her once, though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Said he loved her flaxen hair</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and asked would she go back with him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She go?
- Hell, no!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He didn't have no money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Man! I never would've thought
it could've been this creep.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We don't know that it is, Trish.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought you guys
would've blown Lenore off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dead hooker, who cares?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No one's getting blown off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanna show you something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Get in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey! Not you, her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tight fit in here, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not staying anywhere right now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lenore and me met while we were
studying to be beauticians.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We hit it off right away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look. That's us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Best friend, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Figured you should have a real
picture of her, not some mug shot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's this one?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lenore had this rich John.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was gonna divorce,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">so he gave Lenore the diamond earings
he had just bought for his wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Instead of just keeping it for herself,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">she gives me one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We made friendship rings...
but for the belly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lenore had the other one, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She wore it all the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any mention of a diamond belly
ring in the Norristown report?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, no. Doer probably took it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You the Detectives?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush and Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is difficult for us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We only had one child.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We understand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We already know who k*lled our daughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, we have another suspect
we wanna ask you about.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hmm. Maybe I wasn't clear.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Roy Minard k*lled Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe I wasn't clear.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're Homicide and
we're looking at someone else.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Barry Tepler.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He went to college with Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was here for Thanksgiving.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That kid was harmless.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mr. Richardson,
if someone else is responsible,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know who k*lled Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A father knows.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, Barry was infatuated
with your daughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So was Minard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll come back early,
if you break the rules</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and come see a movie with me in public.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gotta go. My mom has the cake out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is that for me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A ticket to Paris?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who was that on the phone?
- A friend from school.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A man called for you earlier.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dad, I'm not a kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then talk to me like an adult.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Um... he is my art history professor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He seduced her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He fell in love with her...
and who wouldn't?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was just so damn special.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thought you kept your
home and campus life separate, Roy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not even a phone call.
Ain't that what he said?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Except you called
Holly on her birthday.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">At her parents' house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's right. I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Open book.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember, Roy?
- I'd forgotten about that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And maybe you were a little more invested
in Holly than you're telling us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got some other motive here, Minard?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My motive was to get my life
and my career back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">As far as the phone call's concerned,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly... insisted that I
call her on her birthday.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Said if I didn't,
she was gonna call me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what? You said your wife
knew about the affairs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Knowing about it in
the back of your mind</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and hearing a girl's
voice on the line...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">they're two differnt things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly told her dad she broke
things off with you in April.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you were still
going strong in May.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'd tell your dad the truth
about your sex life?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's all that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two hundred and twenty-eight...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">articles on Roy Minard...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">m*rder*r.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The President's Award
for Outstanding Lecturer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why can't they put that on the news?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">People like a story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're a postmodernist.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that's the crux
of the theory, anyway.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Social construction of reality.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you talking about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Society needs a narrative.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, given seemingly
random facts and events,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we need to weave them into a story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Otherwise, the world
wouldn't make any sense.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can see that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do we process
this beautiful young girl dying?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not without a perpetrator.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And so, if one isn't
obvious, we find one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We assign the blame.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It makes the story complete.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's an action-- explanation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Order restored.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why people gotta believe in God, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm-hmm. Exactly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Too many unanswerables without Him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Makes some sense.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I'd be even more fascinated
if I weren't the foil of it all,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but, yes, it does.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It makes some sense.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kite!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, office is closed, Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Seven O'clock?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, well, spare me
the Homicide mantra:</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When your days ends,
ours just begins."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's true.
- Yeah, I've seen the T-shirt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what I'd do with myself
if I went home at : .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, you remember the
Holly Richardson job?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, everybody wanted that one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why? There's nothing on it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pretty Ivy League girl,
philandering professor,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">kind of case gets you on Court TV.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where you'd look like a fool,
'cause the commonwealth had crap?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess. Have you eaten?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I need a search warrant
on this kid Barry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you know any Norristown DA's?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">- 'Cause I haven't eaten.
- I need it right away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This kid knows we're looking at him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sit with me. We'll run the case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or we can do it tomorrow.
I've got, like, minutes at : .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Barry Tepler fits for both jobs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, I got a narrative on him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A story that adds up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had it bad for Holly, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gets rejected by her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then he's hanging around this hooker
Lenore the last few months.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who he claims he didn't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who also rejected him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Both girls are end
up dead in the water.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, if he's so in love with'em,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">why no sexual element to these murders?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, Barry's schizophrenic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A lot of people with that
condition, no sex drive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And the voices you here,
they're powerful.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They tell you to k*ll
someone, you do it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're, uh, knowledgeable, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know someone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where's Lil?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Asking a warrant for Barry's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To find the h**ker's belly ring,
those letters to Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he starts owning up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good night, Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Roy Minard is innocent after all?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hard to assume anything</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but this Barry kid makes...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">more sense.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what's he like Minard?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kind of a cad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But a charming one?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you figure a guy's bad news
if he mixes work and pleasure?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't have a big opinion on that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, uh, I'll call this
Norristown guy in the morning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How come we always talk about work?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause we work together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, tell me something personal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why not?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, Rush. Why not?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm bad at that, and...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gotta go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, let me walk you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll be fine! I'm packing.
- Uh, watch...!¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know... stand still, okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna kiss you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just give it a try.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All you, all you gotta
do is stand there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't panic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's over in three seconds.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Um...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So sit with that overnight and, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">see how it settles in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everything has its place.
Everything has its...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everything has its place.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Read the warrant; we got a right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why are you doing this to me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did I do wrong?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You lied about that</line>
   <line type="dialogue">flaxen-haired hooker,
asking her home and all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just wanted to paint her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pay dirt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guess you lied about having
these letters to Holly, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please don't take those.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got to read'em, Barry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They sent you to ruin my life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">they watch outside in the shadows,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in the closet, behind the coats...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stress is bringing on an episode.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think I can't hear them?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Take him out for some air, will you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That high pitch? Huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like a whistle?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That tries to make you crazy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's it say?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To my Holly:</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If thou wilt needs marry, marry a fool</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for wise men know well enough</line>
   <line type="dialogue">what monsters you make of them."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Some kind of poetry?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe Shakespeare?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No belly ring at Barry's?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm. Turned his place inside out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe sold it for cash.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who set this</line>
   <line type="dialogue">ancient quarrel new abroach?"</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What the hell? I thought this was
about a girl on a balcony.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just find the quote
from Barry's letter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, hold up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is your name Shylock?"</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's not the quote.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know-- it's just the first thing</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've understood in about an hour.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's here, in Hamlet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thank God.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If thou wilt needs marry,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">marry a fool;</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To a nunnery, go, and quickly, too."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hamlet says it to Ophelia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks like it was a
one-sided kind of love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He rejects her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Barry was the one rejected.
- Right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Flip to the back.
How's it end?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, she... goes mad and drowns.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Both our vics were found in the drink.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The "drink"?
You the Bard now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Monster could mean... Barry's illness.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He blames it on Holly?
- Let's find out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">About that belly ring, Scotty's right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Barry could've sold it, you wanna check
consignment and pawn shops?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Once I'm finished with
this scintillating play.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Selling or buying?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Buying.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pawn shop on the corner said
you might have what we want.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't give that Schmuck your business.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The schmuck that has this...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">diamond belly ring...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">is the one gets our business.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just got some vintage cufflinks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The belly ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's all we want.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're missing out, fellas.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're tigereye.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This what you had in mind?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Exactly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nice stone. Two carats.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How much?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ten Bens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Call the seller--</line>
   <line type="dialogue">tell him to come down here
and collect his dough.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you saw you and Holly as a kind of
modern-day Hamlet and Ophelia, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That didn't end well
for that chick in the play, Barry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Didn't end well for Holly, either.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's just a letter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You saying she made you into a monster?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, passion. Passion is the monster.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just...I...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanted to get her attention,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">show her I was sensitive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not like that old...
guy she was seeing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, you knew about Minard?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He shouldn't date students.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's not an equal relationship.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So when Holly was stupid enough</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not to be moved by
your borrowed poetry...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Throw those letters back in your face.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When she stayed in her unequal
relationship with Minard,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and told you to leave
her the hell alone,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you wanted to punish her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Followed her that night,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">snapped off an antenna,
then whip, whip, whip,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">strangel, strangle.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Splash.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw her that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I only talked to her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I know I'm...
I'm not supposed to come near you...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, it's all right, you can.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What happened?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I found out what a b*tch I am.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're not a b*tch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw Minard's wife... and their kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're real.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I pretended they weren't, but...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">they're a family.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guy's not right for you anyway.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh. Well, he doesn't think so.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He wants to stay together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Really?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But, you know, the truth is,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't care about him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was just playing a game,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I... I don't love him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe you could love me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll never love you, either.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Girl you love says that to you,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and you just... get up
and go back to the dorm?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We didn't hear it like that, Barry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We heard Holly was pissed off
at Minard after that party.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lil.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's going on?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly's mother called.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I won't fight you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't care how many
times you hit me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mr. Richardson.
- I'm not gonna hit you back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This won't solve anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You won't take care of this guy,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll do it myself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I am taking care of it.
I'm reinvestigating.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly was an innocent girl,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and this bastard...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was wrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay? I shouldn't
have been with her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You have every reason
to hate me for that,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I did not hurt Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't say that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know you did it. I know it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Please let me handle this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I miss her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly was special.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">M-Maybe you don't
wanna hear that from me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but she talked about you all the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She adored you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know he did it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whoa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you get that warrant okay?
- I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right.
- Thanks. / Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess we won't talk
about the other thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Okay.
- Okay</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shut up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jesus Torres. Ex-con.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tried to sell Lenore Grandy's belly ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's he sayin'?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Some not so nice about Vera's sister.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, looks like you
got two suspects now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This ring belonged to Lenore Grandy,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the hooker you k*lled up in Norristown.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I tell you,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">told you, I didn't k*ll no one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's your parole officer
gonna think all about this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Six months out and you already
got ties to two murders.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Lenore Grandy, two weeks ago,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly Richardson in ' . Same doer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They say "Jesus has
not adjusted to life</line>
   <line type="dialogue">after prison the way we had hoped."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe I took the diamond.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, that's a start.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, but it ain't like you say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What is it like?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I go to the river.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I find the girl dead already, in the water.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I see the ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think, she don't need it now, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah, she's iced.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's all I do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I steal from someone
don't need it anymore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, here's my vision for
what happened, Barry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You met Lenore in your hood,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">fell in love with that flaxen hair,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">which was a lot like Holly's...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly was a honey blonde.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">...and thought, "Well,
here's a Holly look-alike,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and she's just a hooker.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe I can get this one."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just wanted to paint
Lenore; I'm a painter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But then she gives you the high hat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rejected by a whore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's humiliating.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The last straw.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you figure, let me</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gave Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gotta show you something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You study the pre-Raphaelites
there, Jesus?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Que? What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">John Everett Millais
one of your favorites?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's called "Ophelia".</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never saw that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you do recognize that, uh,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lenore was posed just
like poor Ophelia here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know nothing about paintings.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All I did was steal the ring.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was layin' in the water...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">lyin' in the water already dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Say that again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was lyin' in the water dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Chickens lay.
- People lie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You take ESL with Mr. Roy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. Nah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's easy to prove, Jesus.
There's a registry for that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and him made a deal, didn't you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">nine times out of ten, Jesus.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lucky part for you is,
we want Roy more than you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell your side,
we tell the DA you cooperated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I done this before-- , .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't do ten. Five maybe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, it... it's a hooker.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It'll be the easiest
money you've ever made.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's so easy, you do it,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and it'll cost you nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have to be in class
to establish my alibi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I do for six.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right, but remember,
you stick to the script.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everything's gotta be done exactly
like the way it was last time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Comprende, Jesus?
- Si.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I end up teaching this
pathetic class, and, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">it was all to meet you, my friend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's destiny.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll be back after this...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">where I belong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Minard, what's destiny?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's what sets you free.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought it was truth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The truth sets you free.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. It's destiny. Trust me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He only pay me $ , .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So I figure I deserved the jewelry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Seems only fair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Back inside the Ivy walls.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, lunch with the dean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't wanna appear too hopeful,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but the head of my old department</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in stepping down in the fall.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Getting your name cleared
would help a lot, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It couldn't hurt.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you'd be glad to know
we have someone in custody.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who is it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jesus Torres.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A student in your ESL class.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jesus... No, I'm sorry,
that doesn't ring a bell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's not what he says.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He says you told him you k*lled Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What? / And hired him to k*ll
Lenore in a copycat k*lling.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That... that's absurd.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I know you are</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the brilliant professor,
and we're just dump cops...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't think you're dumb.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">have heard of Ophelia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't think you're dumb.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just think you're falling for a story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Almost, Minard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I almost fell for your story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But your boy Jesus
screwed up your plan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he got greedy,
stole some off the body.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Led us back to you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jesus is a lifetime criminal</line>
   <line type="dialogue">with a third-world education.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought you didn't know him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You have his word against mine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It hardly makes a case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. But the second body being
posed just like the first,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that makes my case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Public didn't know those details.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Only Holly's k*ller did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And who's gonna believe a dummy like
Jesus ever studied art history.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had to regain my station.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Jesus offered a way to do that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You knew about Barry's
letters to Holly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Calling her his "Ophelia".</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She showed me a few of them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pillow talk, if you will.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you just needed to find
another girl to link Barry to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Make it look like she was
his second Ophelia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Frame him for both.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guy's just a schizo,
what's his life worth, anyway?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I contribute.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't look at me like
I'm some kind of monster.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Holly shares some of the
blame of this, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, really?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What'd Holly do?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She made me love her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You left angry...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I could tell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What? What's wrong?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing's wrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's just over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What makes you say that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You have a wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then I'll leave her for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I will. I will.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I really will.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought I loved you, but
it was only in a childish way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, this hard-to-get act
is a little juvenile for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, I just wanted to have fun.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't even think about your family.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you hear what I just said...
that I love you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I don't love you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't love anyone.
- Except yourself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, and you love you,
and that's why we get along so well.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I say when it's over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I make the rules.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I decide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I decide!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I decide!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I decide.</line>
