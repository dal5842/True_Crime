   <line type="dialogue">November ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's fun, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's better than watching frat guys
playing beer pong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You get credit for working
on the campaign?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh yeah, but I'd do it anyway.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Does it bother you that
he's such a womanizer?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's not gonna do
that in the White House.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's the face?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's David Lake.
He runs our campaign office.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That his girlfriend?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vanessa, that drunk they threw out,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">is he with you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not with him any..
- Cuz that was embarrassing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know, I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It wasn't her fault, Abbey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">David, we never got to talk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, later. I promise.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, him, I'd vote for.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're saying
he's the future of the party.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's loud in here.
You wanna walk outside?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What took you so long?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had to doll up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vera got lucky.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm on the up desk all night,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">eight minutes to go on the shift
and this guy's gotta buy it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Darren Clemen, two in the head.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Up close.
- Any witnesses?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They heard it,
but they didn't see it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Working cold jobs, you almost
forget how much blood there is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It does seem extra gory.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm assuming there's a good reason
we got dragged down here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Inside.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The guy didn't believe in house work.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks like some kind of shrine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or a trophy case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">About the death of Vanessa Prosser.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">m*rder victim, .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never found her k*ller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Never say never.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vanessa Prosser was
a college senior working</line>
   <line type="dialogue">on the local Clinton campaign.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Went to election party
on November, rd, .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Washed up on the bank of
the Delaware the next morning
with a broken neck.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Republicans thought
they had a bad night</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Best guess is she was tossed
from the Ben Franklin bridge.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It could've been a fall.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bruising under her arms.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dragged and dumped.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A letter was found in her pocket.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Signature and most of
the prints were washed away,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but few words are readable.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Been afraid..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wanting to..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Feelings for you...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">An admirer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">With good penmanship.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lead suspect was Aaron Dutra,
Vanessa's ex,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">an ROTC Penn-grad just
gotten back from the Gulf w*r.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He got thrown
out of the party that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Case against him didn't stick, though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hmm, among other things,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">bad penmanship.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We think the letter came from
Clemen, this new victim.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He had a kind of
an obssession with her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What else do we know
about this guy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No record, no warrants.
Name's clean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can't say the same for his house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Neighbor said the wife died
three years ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He turned into a hermit,
let the place go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And the relationship between him
and the Prosser girl?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No connections, yet, but he did
have some of her personal items.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Receipts, school papers,
journal entries.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he was stalking her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But how'd he get her stuff?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Walter Spar was assigned to this
case. Will, do you know where he is?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe the shore, I'll find him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's see if Vanessa's parents
know who Clemen was to her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.
I don't know him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who is he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His name is Darren Clemen.
He was k*lled last night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">k*lled?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's this got to do with Vanessa?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were hoping you could tell us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was living at home, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, she was trying to save money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She wanted to spend
the summer in Washington.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This man had some of
Vanessa's things at his house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I don't understand
how that could be.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One theory is Vanessa was
involved with this guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But, he looks like he's twice her age.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Though that might explain something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Few weeks before Vanessa died,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we were making dinner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">George Bush is a w*r hero.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He doesn't know
what a grocery scanner is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I, for one,
like that Hillary Clinton.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I liked her headbands, and I don't
know why she had to change it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dad, you have to vote for Clinton.
I need a job next year.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And never mind
the Jennifer Flowers tapes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jennifer Flowers is a skank.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's one thing we can agree on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ahem. For Vanessa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Aaron? Still thinks
he's in the game, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, not from Aaron.
- Oh? Who from?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's just a thank-you
from the campaign.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, oh, apply pressure. Here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Direct pressure, come on. Hold it.
Grab it, honey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hurry up, hurry up. Here we go.
Keep pressing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And then we got distracted
when she cut herself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her blood didn't clot properly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you never found out
who sent the flowers?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This says you didn't realize that
Vanessa was missing till the next day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We figured she'd gone back to her
friend's place on campus, Beth Reardon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She drove that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You build all these?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just design them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm an architect, not the contractor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've never seen him before.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who is he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe someone Vanessa
was involved with.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I doubt that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You have better candidate?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought she had something going on,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but she was being secretive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyone else who might know
who Vanessa was seeing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ask Aaron Dutra.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was all but stalking
her at the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her old boyfriend?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She broke up with him, but he
wasn't taking no for an answer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You see him at the party that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was hard to miss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I couldn't vote for Clinton,
I was too jealous of the Gore girls.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gore is crazy.
He kept dropping out of the race.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I liked Stockdale in the debate.
- Vanessa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why are you here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were supposed to wait, V.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're drunk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shut up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Aaron, it's over.
I told you this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw you with him today.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're following me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw him touch you, like you're his..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stop.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where is he? / Aaron.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where is he?
I know he's here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Aaron. Sleep it off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cops had asked me
about him the first time around.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was an idiot, but</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not a k*ller.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You and Aaron ever compare notes</line>
   <line type="dialogue">on who this other guy
might have been?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Aaron and I never compared anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He got sick after that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sick?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I heard it was Gulf w*r Syndrome.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds like Vanessa's ex saw her</line>
   <line type="dialogue">with the new admirer
the day she died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You've gone to him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was too sick to see us today.
We'll go back tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was Walter's partner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He remembers the Prosser case?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remembers Darren Clemen, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Said he started coming around
few years back,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">had a bunch of theories
on how the girl died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What, he came with here with theories?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thought it was some kind of
political conspiracy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, he was trying to solve her m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why was he interested in Vanessa?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We still don't have a connection.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe we do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remember all the blood
at the Clemen scene?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The autopsy explained it,
he was a hemophilliac.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like Vanessa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wait, it's hereditary?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Coroner says yes.
Females are just carriers,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but some show symptoms.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blood relation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vanessa was
Darren Clemen's daughter?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, he was Vanessa's father.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It wasn't even an affair.
It was just one night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were already married?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Darren was
my high school sweetheart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We had our ten year reunion.
His pals had a suite upstairs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Old time's sake?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stupid,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">very stupid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My husband doesn't know
and neither did Vanessa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Darren keep in touch?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, we agreed on that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We had separate lives
till three years ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When he started looking into
Vanessa's death?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His wife had died.
Said he was trying to fill the void.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any idea who he suspected?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I let him look through Vanessa's things</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and then I asked him not to come back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had just lost my daughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I couldn't risk losing
my husband, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If Clemen was looking into Vanessa's
m*rder and got too close to the truth,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that could explain his death, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So we're thinking one doer
for both murders.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta find out what Clemen knew.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who he was after.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where you been, Scotty?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charming the pants off for
a -year-old historian
who works for the DNC.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You get the photo?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everyone on the regional
campaign in ' ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">taken at the day of the election.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vanessa's ex came to the party
looking for her new guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe the new guy's here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's Kite with?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I heard you and him were..
- Yeah, I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's go see
if Aaron's feeling better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whatever it is,
I was here watching  TV.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's about Vanessa Prosser.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Of course, it is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The night of her m*rder, you showed
up at the election party pretty upset.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look at your records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've had this conversation
a hundred times already.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's make it hundred and one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was the turkey talking, burbon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've been drinking all day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you turn off the cooking show?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Before I went to the Gulf,
Vanessa and I got engaged.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When I got back, she was
supposed to be waiting for me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And instead she found
someone new?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could you ID her
new boyfriend from a picture?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Him.
Glasses, front.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're sure?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thank you very much.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I voted, did you? / Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know, I consider myself
a reasonably smart guy,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What happens if you don't
knock out little square all the way?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who knows?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">David Lake.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know that name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Abbey Lake.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Congressman's chief of staff.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives Rush and Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sister, not wife.
Everyone makes that mistake.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're here to talk to David.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, sorry, he's in Washington.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe I can help?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're looking into an old homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vanessa Prosser?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was awful.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was a really nice girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We heard she and your brother
might have been involved.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her and David?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You sure?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A lot of girls in the campaign
were charmed by David.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's the story of his life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Occupational hazard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vanessa was a lot
like the other girls.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ready?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are we in a hurry?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have a conference call
in an hour.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll see you at the party?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">David, I have something I want to ...
- The polls close in four hours.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We need you on the phones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Final push.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'll see him tonight, Vanessa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was sweet,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but young, naive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Starstruck?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">David's only human.
He gets flattered.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Part of my job was
and is keeping him focused.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Still, we'd like to talk to your brother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Soon as he's back in town.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm here at the local
Democratic election party</line>
   <line type="dialogue">have helped Bill Clinton...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">election night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Abbey Lake, David's sister.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And the future congressman himself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No Vanessa, though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could be out of frame.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could be dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We think Lake had a relationship
with Vanessa?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His sister says no.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, we'll see if his handwriting
matches that letter found on her body.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Be delicate, Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He runs to his friends
in the mayor's office,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm the one who gets the call.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What else do we know about him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Been in Washington since ,
elected to Congress two years ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Went to Princeton,
Columbia Law.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Raised up north in Redding.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Redding?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My victim made a couple calls to
Redding the day he got shot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Clemen did?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. To a guy named Marvin Dobie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Marvin Dobie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Philadelphia Homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, so?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, nice. Custom job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bamboo rod, tail water reel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Expensive hobby.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Convictions for fraud,
forgery, bad checks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which of those hobbies
got you that rod?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you want from me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know a guy named
Darren Clemen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Really?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He called you last week.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, maybe
he got a wrong number.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Talk to wrong numbers
for six minutes?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe I got lonely.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Clemen got k*lled later that day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know anything about that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dead, whoa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Know him now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about her?
Name's Vanessa Prosser.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry, anyone else?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about Congressman
David Lake?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I'll have him,
he's from the neighborhood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You friendly?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't say that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I gotta get to the scrap yard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This your writing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, man.
That's the architect.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They all write like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Old set of blueprints from Dobie.
Check on the print.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here's the letter from Vanessa's
pocket. Compare this two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dobie's architect wrote
Vanessa a love letter?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They almost match.
- Almost.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is called lettering.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You look at any set of plans,
it basically looks like this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All architects print this way for clarity.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, it's hard to tell one from the next.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And we only got one architect
in this investigation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Beth Reardon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where did you find this?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was in Vanessa's pocket.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's your writing, isn't it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess I was kind of in love with her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's my fault she died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why do you say that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We went outside.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I knew something was bothering her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't worry about Aaron.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He'll regret it all in the morning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then what are you worried about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're not telling me something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ever wish you could just go backwards</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and unlearn something?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just want things to be simple.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But they're a mess.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell me what you mean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Beth. / I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what to say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't say anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just read.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was awry that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I hadn't left, maybe
she'd still be alive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You told the first detectives you were
at home the rest of the night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Passed out on my bathroom floor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So no alibi, then?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's my alibi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's where I was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about this past Thursday night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was in the ER.
My son had an asthma attack.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Vanessa ever mention
the name Marvin Dobie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ex-con from Redding.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No bells?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Redding.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Um, she took a bus to Redding,
a few days before the election.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She say why?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I heard her on the phone
checking schedules.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When I asked her about about it,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">she changed the subject.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Darren Clemen calls Dobie
in Redding, ends up dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vanessa goes to Redding..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably to contact Dobie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Same ending.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All roads lead to Redding.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Congressman's hometown.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Believe me, I understand
the need for low income housing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I come from humble beginnings,
and if it were up to me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we'd break ground tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But we just simply
don't have the resources.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Me siento mucho.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He just told them he sets down a lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gracias, gracias.
Thank you for coming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How are you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vanessa and I worked
on the campaign together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That all you did together?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We hear you may have been
more than co-workers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Excuse me, just had lasik.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Put it off as long as I could.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in both eyes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Contacts never seem to fit right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This a fillibuster, Congressman?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vanessa and I were involved.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But you kept it quiet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I didn't want more than
one people in the campaign to know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And after Vanessa died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My coming forward
wouldn't have helped.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wouldn't helped you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had no information.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I was concerned about being
associated with an event like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even though it was
your girlfriend that got k*lled?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She wasn't though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We broke things off that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You been avoiding me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I think you have that reversed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where's your friend?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She went home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And the ex-boyfriend?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't care.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">V, I've been offered a position</line>
   <line type="dialogue">in Washington.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's great. / Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's what you wanted.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thing is,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">it wouldn't make sense for us
to make this long distance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought the idea was that we were</line>
   <line type="dialogue">gonna go to Washington together,
not break up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Things have a way of turning
on a dime in this business.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is it because of Abbey?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did Abbey have to do with it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was always worried about
loose ends with the girls I dated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ever get back to your humble
beginnings in Redding?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not really, no time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cuz Vanessa did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, went to see a guy
named Marvin Dobie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know the name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Says he lived in your neighborhood.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I pride myself on my ability to
remember people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for being frank with us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If there's one thing I learned
from Bill Clinton,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">never lie about that sort of thing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he didn't lie about Vanessa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He lied about Dobie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You found a connection?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, pulled the forms to see
who posted bail</line>
   <line type="dialogue">on Dobie's arrest. Fraud, ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">by Linda Savis.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got her own record for prostitution,
but only once under that name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In her married year,
she was known as..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Linda Lake.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mother of David and Abbey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did she had to do with Dobie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shared an address for an year.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably a boyfriend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Dobie didn't live in the same
neighborhood with David Lake.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He lived in the same house.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Lake can't place the name.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which is doubly curious considering
the checks he's been writing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Marvin Dobie</line>
   <line type="dialogue">has been getting payments
from a trust since the late eighties,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a trust set up by David Lake.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had the congressman giving
Dobie a financial support?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But what is Dobie giving him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You said you didn't know
Darren Clemen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or Vanessa Prosser.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We think you did though and
now they're both dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not cuz of me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cuz of something you know then?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You also lied
about Congressman Lake.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not only did you know him,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you lived in his house
when he was a teenager.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I ain't talking about Lake.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't want them checks
to stop coming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone's going away
for this girl's m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Comes down to you or Lake,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">who do you think gets
the benefit of the doubt?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The congressman or
the ex-con?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lake has resources,
lawyers, status.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What have you got?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Self respect.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's more than he can say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You tell me I don't get rung up
on some extortion rap.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I tell you what you wanna know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think we can sell that to the D.A.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Clemen called me up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Said he found my name
in this girl's stuff.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How that happened, I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Asked what I knew
about her getting k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What'd you tell him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing to tell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't know she was dead.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I met her that one time.
That's all I knew of her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So Vanessa did visit you in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know how she found me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She just showed up at my door,
out of the blue.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why does David Lake
send you money?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">David who, darling?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I'm not looking for trouble.
I just..</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just wanna know why.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know
what you're talking about.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He writes you checks.
I've seen them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you some kind of a reporter?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm a friend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You go home, little girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Buy yourself some shoes,
take your mind off of things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what you're doing,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I know enough to call the police.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why don't you just ask David?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He won't tell me anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You aren't just a friend of his,
aren't you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">God, I almost feel bad for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why did you feel bad for her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was in over her head.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">See,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">David and his sister Abbey,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">they were more than friends, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Brother and sister.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dobie caught them a few times
while he was living with them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He have proof?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What, like pictures?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. / No, no pictures.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But David and Abbey were worried
enough to be paying him off
for past years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Man, I voted for this guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dobie told Vanessa Prosser about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We think she went and
confronted the happy couple.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And got k*lled for it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And last week, Dobie called
the congressman</line>
   <line type="dialogue">to report that Darren Clemen
was sniffing around.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Few hours later, Clemen ends up
with two in the head.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Lake was in D.C. that day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dobie says Abbey took the call.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you think Abbey did both jobs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When it comes to her brother,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Abbey takes care of everything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dobie's got a sheet like a w*r
and peace, Kite.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he can be compelled to testify.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hearsay from a repeat felon
won't buy you much.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna get our m*rder?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You gotta get her to talk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't k*ll anyone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What would give you
an idea like that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not what,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">who.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Acquaintance of yours.
Kind of an in-law actually.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Marvin Dobie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What rock did he crawl out
from under?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You should know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You paid for it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hush money couldn't keep
him quiet though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your own brother, Abbey?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My own brother what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When it gets out David Lake took
advantage of his sister</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when they were teenagers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That'll finish him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you have any idea
how that sounds?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know how it's gonna read.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">National Enquirer, Star.
- The jit papers, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, they'll stop
the presses for this one.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That would be slander,
we'd sue you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">By that time, everyone will know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Canon, ring a bell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That charming brother of
yours won't have a career left.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe that's what Abbey wants.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To have her favorite guy all to herself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why you k*lled Vanessa,
isn't it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you say, Abbey?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We call up the gossip rags or
you start spilling.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I need assurances.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You keep certain things
out of the press.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They'll come out at trial.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not if I plead guilty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">David didn't take advantage of me,
I was older.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Vanessa found this out?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She should've minded her
own business.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Adams Morgan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about Georgetown?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It'd be so great if we could work
at the White House.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Assuming Clinton wins.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We could get an apartment together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dog?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Both.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanna go to every museum
on the mall.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's easy train trip back to Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It would be great, V.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Abbey. / Hi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry, it's late, I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How long have
you been standing there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just got here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I need you to sign some checks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's his new number.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forget it, we can't let him
keep raising the amount.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You want a future in the public eye,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you pay him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then we get a girl curious.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I'd been more successful
at deflecting her,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't have had to do
what I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which was?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I sent her down the stairs
to the hotel parking garage,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">then dumped her from the bridge.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All for David's brilliant career?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I owed him</line>
   <line type="dialogue">for what I did
when we were young.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And David agreed to sweep
the sound of the rug?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He doesn't know anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about Clemen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doesn't know about him either.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You admit to sh**ting him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two sh*ts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was as close as
you are right now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That was your . ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">IT was a . .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You can find it in my apartment.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, we got a g*n.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ballistics will test fire and compare
but she looks good for it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that'll make the bosses happy.
Better her than the congressman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were getting
nervous upstairs, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can I show you something?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He ain't wearing his glasses.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So? / So,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">where'd they go?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I lose mine three times a day,
Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're not blind without them.
Lake said he had vision.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's your theory?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe lost them in a struggle.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Abbey's taking the fall.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In her twisted devotion to David,
she figures better to let him go on</line>
   <line type="dialogue">doing all his good,
she'll sit in jail.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a little thin.
- It makes sense.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Scotty, we got nothing on him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know he did it.
- But we can't make the case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sooner or later, Scotty,
one's gonna get by you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Happens to us all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wanna go see Lake
one more time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know who Darren Clemen is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's Vanessa's real father.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was looking into her death.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which means he was looking into you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think I k*lled Vanessa?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Leaning there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Except, your sister says she did it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She said that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Made a deal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Copped to both murders
in exchange,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">we don't leak your dirty little secret.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I have to call Abbey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Without your help,
she's looking at life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How can I help?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell us what happened to Vanessa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Excuse me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't have anything more to say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He almost sweat in there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know that call Stillman
didn't want to get from the brass?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He got it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have to leave Lake alone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Commissioner's orders.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Heard you went back
at the congressman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Till the bosses shut us down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got a pretty good case against the sister.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, it must be nice having
a different set of rules.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Saw you with that new A.D.A.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julie? / Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Actually, I'm on my way to meet her now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Have fun.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll cut her loose right now
if it's just you and me,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but I haven't heard that from you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So until you've decided that...
- Okay, okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just you and me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then, I'll go meet her right now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Be polite for now and tell her
that I'm otherwise engaged.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Congressman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're not allowed to be here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Off duty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just two guys talking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't think so.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your life's pretty important, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everyone's life is important.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not Vanessa's apparently.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or Abbey's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind of man
lets his sister take his b*llet?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't know about Abbey and me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know more than I want to know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We had a hard upbringing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, humble beginnings.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a lot worse than humble.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It made us very close.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't make you understand.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't need to understand that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just want the truth about Vanessa,
how she died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got a law degree, right.
You know about Miranda.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. / Well, I haven't Mirandized you,
so anything you tell me right now,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't use it in court.
You're protected.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And we can have a conversation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">About what? / The truth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why would you wanna
know something</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you could do nothing about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's for me to know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What you need to know is
I ain't leaving till you tell me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought that she had left the party.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never expected to see her again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vanessa,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">what are you doing here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went to Redding this weekend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I met Marvin Dobie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why would you do that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just wanted to know
what was coming between us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did he say?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It doesn't matter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did he say?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He told me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">About you and Abbey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's all right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vanessa, we can't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can be together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You just have to look forward
and not back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I love you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">V.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh god, Vanessa.</line>
