   <line>Come on, guys!
Over here, now!</line>
   <line>Listen up, listen up.</line>
   <line>We're down one and we need a score.</line>
   <line>You boys do what I tell you,
you'll be state champinos!</line>
   <line>I want the ball in Herman's hand.</line>
   <line>The rest of you guys just clear
out of his way, you understand?</line>
   <line>All right, bring it in.
Saints on three.</line>
   <line>One, two, three...
- Saints!</line>
   <line>Herman...</line>
   <line>Put us your back and get us a win.</line>
   <line>Let's go, Herman, baby!</line>
   <line>Herman, Herman,
do your uncle right, baby.</line>
   <line>Do your uncle right!</line>
   <line>Please, Lord, give young Herman
the strength to do me right.</line>
   <line>Please! Come on, Herman.
Come on, baby.</line>
   <line>Let's do it, baby.
Come on.</line>
   <line>You figure : a.m.'s the right
time to start the day, boss?</line>
   <line>These guys have been
here for an hour, Lil.</line>
   <line>You ever hear of Herman Lester?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>Ah, he's only the best basketball
player who ever lived.</line>
   <line>Yeah? / And died.</line>
   <line>He was m*rder*d on a playground
court in . Never sloved.</line>
   <line>So what are we doing here?</line>
   <line>You see the kid with the ball?</line>
   <line>That's Herman's son.</line>
   <line>Ball never touches the floor.</line>
   <line>And make the layup now.
Let's go!</line>
   <line>John. / Coach.</line>
   <line>Thanks for coming.
- No problem.</line>
   <line>This is Detective Rush.</line>
   <line>Nice to meet you.
- Pleasure.</line>
   <line>Look, look, watch this.</line>
   <line>Doesn't have Herman's
size, but ... more range.</line>
   <line>And the same confidence.</line>
   <line>I tell you, John, it's like
coaching Herman all over again.</line>
   <line>Hey, Ray! Come here!</line>
   <line>Let's have him walk us
through this phone call he got.</line>
   <line>Some kind of threat?</line>
   <line>Ray, these are Philadelphia police.</line>
   <line>Gonna help us out.</line>
   <line>Hey. / Hey.</line>
   <line>Hi, Ray.</line>
   <line>Want to tell us about
the phone call you got?</line>
   <line>Not much to it.</line>
   <line>I'm home, pick up the phone and hear.</line>
   <line>If I play Friday night,</line>
   <line>I'm gonna get the screwdriver,
just like my dad.</line>
   <line>Screwdriver?</line>
   <line>It was the m*rder w*apon.</line>
   <line>So... what's Friday night?</line>
   <line>State championship.</line>
   <line>Uh, no idea who it was
male, female, young, old?</line>
   <line>Male. Can't say about the rest.</line>
   <line>Ray, you having any problem in school?</line>
   <line>Any issues on or off the court?</line>
   <line>Nah. Things are cool.</line>
   <line>Okay, Ray. Thanks.</line>
   <line>Back out there.</line>
   <line>I need him in the lineup Friday.</line>
   <line>Do really think this threat is
connected to Herman's m*rder?</line>
   <line>Well, the kid's a phenom like his dad.</line>
   <line>They both lead their teams
to the state championship.</line>
   <line>Herman gets m*rder*d,</line>
   <line>now Ray gets this death threat.</line>
   <line>Enough connection for me.</line>
   <line>We'll check with the phone company,</line>
   <line>see if we can trace where
the call came from.</line>
   <line>And pull Herman Lester's case.</line>
   <line>I wish you'd have eaten more.</line>
   <line>I ate all the melon.
- Yeah.</line>
   <line>Yeah, and you made sure the
home fries didn't go to waste.</line>
   <line>I like being out here.</line>
   <line>In the cold.</line>
   <line>I'll get you a cab. / Yeah?</line>
   <line>What? What is it?</line>
   <line>There's a giant behind you.</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>Well, look for yourself.</line>
   <line>Yeah, look for yourself.</line>
   <line>Oh, man.</line>
   <line>What... what are you doing here?</line>
   <line>Just getting my coffee.</line>
   <line>What are you doing here?</line>
   <line>Uh, uh, just, uh, coffee.</line>
   <line>Will Jeffries.
- Elisa.</line>
   <line>Sorry. Bonehead.
We work together.</line>
   <line>Pleasure to meet you.</line>
   <line>See you at work, Scotty.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>So, uh, a cab, right?</line>
   <line>Guess, uh, Jeffries is
kind of a giant, ain't he?</line>
   <line>Probably should've said "big".</line>
   <line>If Herman Lester had lived,</line>
   <line>of Dr.J as just another player.</line>
   <line>Come on, boss.</line>
   <line>The good doctor would jump so high,</line>
   <line>he could pick a dollar off
the top of the backboards.</line>
   <line>Scotty, Herman Lester
would leave change.</line>
   <line>Whatever Herman did,
he returned to earth</line>
   <line>of a Phillips screwdriver.</line>
   <line>Yeah. Pierced once through the heart.</line>
   <line>And bled out like a mere mortal
on the court at Player's Park.</line>
   <line>Suspects?</line>
   <line>One. Billy Berkenpass, a teammate.</line>
   <line>Good player in his own right,
but no Herman.</line>
   <line>Says here that was the problem.</line>
   <line>Berknepass hated playing
second fiddle to Herman.</line>
   <line>Attitude got him booted off the team.</line>
   <line>He missed the state championship
same night Herman dead.</line>
   <line>Yeah, he lost out in love, too.</line>
   <line>Tanya Williams dumped Berkenpass
for Herman a few months earlier.</line>
   <line>Double motive.</line>
   <line>Footnote says maybe Herman was iced
by a bagman from a top school?</line>
   <line>Sounds like urban legend.</line>
   <line>Yeah, smart money was on Berkenpass.
On top of everything else.</line>
   <line>kids saw him confront Herman
at an after-game party that night.</line>
   <line>So why didn't he go down?</line>
   <line>No hard evidence,
and he had an alibi.</line>
   <line>Time of the m*rder, he claimed
he was home with his dad.</line>
   <line>Aw, Dad vouching for
you ain't exactly airtight.</line>
   <line>Are we sure this job is
connected to Ray's death threat?</line>
   <line>Well, seems like it.</line>
   <line>Especially since the threat was made
from a pay phone at the City Center Rec.</line>
   <line>Yeah, and guess who hoops it up
there, every day over lunch hour.</line>
   <line>Berkenpass.</line>
   <line>Your son says he was with you
the night Herman Lester was k*lled.</line>
   <line>Yeah, we sat in front of
the tube till : a.m.</line>
   <line>You always watch  TV that late?</line>
   <line>No, just that night.</line>
   <line>Good, Bad and the Ugly was on.</line>
   <line>Got a pretty specific memory there.</line>
   <line>I've only been asked the
question about times.</line>
   <line>Hey, hey, hey!</line>
   <line>No reason for you to touch that.</line>
   <line>So, that night...</line>
   <line>Billy must've been pretty steamed,
after what happened to him.</line>
   <line>What do you mean?</line>
   <line>Him getting kicked off the team,
missing the big game.</line>
   <line>My kid got screwed.</line>
   <line>Plus, Herman taking up with
his ex-girlfriend, Tanya, right?</line>
   <line>Got screwed twice.</line>
   <line>He was better off losing the girl.</line>
   <line>You didn't like her?</line>
   <line>I don't like any girls in the picture.</line>
   <line>Women weaking legs.
That's no good for basketball.</line>
   <line>Look, it's admirable,</line>
   <line>Yeah, somebody had to.</line>
   <line>Within hours, you cops were all
over that boy for the m*rder of Lester.</line>
   <line>The kid was years old.</line>
   <line>I guess you didn't get enough,</line>
   <line>cause now you're at it again.</line>
   <line>Why are you asking about Herman?</line>
   <line>We're reopening his m*rder case.</line>
   <line>No, leave it alone. Leave it.</line>
   <line>Tanya, we think looking at Herman's
case will help your son's situation.</line>
   <line>How?</line>
   <line>Tanya, let Uncle Freddie handle this.</line>
   <line>I'm the man who raised Herman,</line>
   <line>and I been like a father to Ray, too.</line>
   <line>So tell me.
How will it help?</line>
   <line>We think Billy Berkenpass may
have made the call to Ray.</line>
   <line>That's the dude who k*lled dad?
- We don't know that.</line>
   <line>Oh, that white boy was
so jealous of your pop!</line>
   <line>Freddie, don't start.</line>
   <line>Ray, you recognize this guy?</line>
   <line>Oh, man... that's The Ghost.</line>
   <line>The Ghost"?</line>
   <line>When I'm out playing pickup,
he's there watching.</line>
   <line>White dude looks at me funny.</line>
   <line>How long's this been going on?</line>
   <line>Ever since I started making
a name for myself.</line>
   <line>Maybe about two years ago.</line>
   <line>The Ghost ever approach you?
- Nah.</line>
   <line>That's it!
Uncle Freddie's stepping in.</line>
   <line>Ray ain't playing Friday.</line>
   <line>You said there'd be security,
right? / Right.</line>
   <line>No, no, no! No risk!</line>
   <line>The boy is going League, understand?</line>
   <line>League?</line>
   <line>NBA pro scouts already got Ray marked
down as a first-round draft choice.</line>
   <line>Ray hasn't decided where he's
going next year, Freddie, so shut it.</line>
   <line>Hopefully, we clear this whole
thing before the game.</line>
   <line>Are you sure Billy called my son?</line>
   <line>Not a hundred percent.</line>
   <line>I never believed he k*lled Herman.</line>
   <line>No?</line>
   <line>Me and Billy dated.
I knew him.</line>
   <line>It'd really help if you'd tell us what
you remember about that night, Tanya.</line>
   <line>We won the state championship...</line>
   <line>then there was a party.</line>
   <line>Philly Tech says he's their guy.</line>
   <line>But off the court, this man is mine.</line>
   <line>Where the hell's Herman?</line>
   <line>Billy... what are you doing here?</line>
   <line>Being friends.</line>
   <line>Isn't that what you said, Tanya?
We'd be friends?</line>
   <line>Yo, don't be mad at her, man.</line>
   <line>Okay, I'll be mad at you.</line>
   <line>You take my girl, I'm
supposed to be cool with it?</line>
   <line>Oh, man, you're drunk.
- Don't you walk away from me...</line>
   <line>Let him up, let him up, let him up!
Come on. Get off him!</line>
   <line>Get off him.</line>
   <line>You want to talk, Billy?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>I'm on your home court here.</line>
   <line>I'll catch you later.</line>
   <line>How did Herman end up
in Player's Park that night?</line>
   <line>He'd go there to clear his head.</line>
   <line>What's Player's Park?</line>
   <line>It's across town.
It's where your dad died.</line>
   <line>Back in Herman's day that's where
a player would go to prove himself.</line>
   <line>We'll let you know what
we find out, Tanya.</line>
   <line>Billy Berkenpass?
- Yes?</line>
   <line>Detectives Valens and Rush.
Can we have a minute?</line>
   <line>Doing real good, Michael.</line>
   <line>Can we...?</line>
   <line>Should have known you
people would show up.</line>
   <line>Why is that?</line>
   <line>Everyone knows Ray Lester
got a death threat.
I'm sure you think I made it.</line>
   <line>The call was made from
the City Center Rec.</line>
   <line>Where you play ball every day.</line>
   <line>Guess someone's trying
to make me look bad.</line>
   <line>We got some prints off the phone.</line>
   <line>One of them gonna be yours, Billy.</line>
   <line>I'll let you find that out for yourself.</line>
   <line>Let's talk about , when your
teammate Herman died...</line>
   <line>Knew this was coming.</line>
   <line>... not long after Tanya
broke up with you for him.</line>
   <line>That pretty hard on you?</line>
   <line>Yeah. First heartbreak.</line>
   <line>What happened?</line>
   <line>Black girl. White guy.
The world wasn't rooting for us.</line>
   <line>Hey, sports question:
think much of Ray's game?</line>
   <line>Paper says he's the second
coming of Herman.</line>
   <line>What do you say?
- I've seen him a lot.</line>
   <line>He's as good as advertised.</line>
   <line>I didn't call that kid,
I didn't k*ll Herman.</line>
   <line>Right. "Home with your dad."</line>
   <line>So, if it wasn't you, Billy,
who was it?</line>
   <line>Recuriting was out of
control over Herman.</line>
   <line>One coach handed him a motel key,
said he had a super model waiting for him.</line>
   <line>Saying Herman took that room key?</line>
   <line>Not that one, but I saw
him take another key.</line>
   <line>I mean, who knows how many
programs Herman took gifts from.</line>
   <line>But a player can only
make one school happy.</line>
   <line>Herman was about to piss off
a university, so they k*ll him?</line>
   <line>Pretty far out theory, Billy.</line>
   <line>Maybe not a president,
or a dean, but...</line>
   <line>you'd be suprised what the round
ball's made grown men do.</line>
   <line>Yeah, there was a car... for a day.</line>
   <line>I got right in Herman's face, told him
the car goes back where it came from.</line>
   <line>Which was where?</line>
   <line>Well, that I didn't need to know.</line>
   <line>Bottom line, Herman was
on the bus the next day.</line>
   <line>Billy Berkenpass thinks Herman
received other under-the-table gifts.</line>
   <line>Billy Berkenpass has been
trying to muddy Herman's name</line>
   <line>since the day I kicked him off the team.</line>
   <line>What happened there?</line>
   <line>I guess enough time has passed.</line>
   <line>I'll tell you.</line>
   <line>That's right. I'm talking about
you and Big Ed Brown.</line>
   <line>You better watch your mouth, man!
- Hey, what the hell's problem?</line>
   <line>Herman don't want to win tonight.
- That's crap!</line>
   <line>Cause his bookie, Big Ed Brown,
he owns Herman.</line>
   <line>That's not true, coach. Come on.</line>
   <line>Then why'd he offer me bucks
to join you in messing the game?</line>
   <line>Don't you lie, Billy.
- It's the truth. He's on the take.</line>
   <line>You gonna talk about Herman
like that you're off this team!</line>
   <line>Coach! / You're off this team!</line>
   <line>He'd saying anything
to take down to Herman.</line>
   <line>Attitude problem three years running.</line>
   <line>Nothing to his allegations?</line>
   <line>Herman won the game for us.</line>
   <line>Shook four guys and
dunked on a seven-footer.</line>
   <line>End of story, okay?</line>
   <line>End of story.</line>
   <line>Oh! Boy, he missed a bunny.
- That's like three in a row.</line>
   <line>- ' State Championship?
- Yeah.</line>
   <line>Herman's last night on earth.</line>
   <line>He turned the ball over again.</line>
   <line>Okay, and now here's the end.</line>
   <line>Okay. Freeze it, Scotty.</line>
   <line>Now, he just won the championship,</line>
   <line>wild, but look at Herman.</line>
   <line>Nothing.</line>
   <line>Maybe he agreed to throw the game,
but in the end couldn't do it.</line>
   <line>That would explain why he's not smiling.</line>
   <line>And maybe why he got k*lled.</line>
   <line>So, was that the lady keeps calling you?</line>
   <line>Don't do that.</line>
   <line>Do what?
- Sneak up on me.</line>
   <line>I'm not sneaking up on you.
- I meant just like on the street with Elisa.</line>
   <line>Look, don't shadow me, okay?
Especially if you see me with her.</line>
   <line>What was that about?</line>
   <line>I don't know.
Guy's losing it?</line>
   <line>Hey, boss.</line>
   <line>For you. Big Ed Brown, the guy
Berkenpass said approached him.</line>
   <line>Longtime bookie.</line>
   <line>Illegal lottery, bookmaking; spanked
with a bunch of probation, no jail time.</line>
   <line>Maybe Vice has something on him.</line>
   <line>See if I can get a hammer on him.</line>
   <line>Hey, where's Lil?</line>
   <line>Went to check with Ray to see</line>
   <line>throwing this Friday's game.</line>
   <line>Mm. See if history's repeating itself.</line>
   <line>Ray, can I steal you for a minutes?</line>
   <line>You catch that guy who
called me? / Not yet.</line>
   <line>I gotta ask you, Ray,</line>
   <line>to fix the game this Friday?</line>
   <line>No way.</line>
   <line>How about other games
during the season?</line>
   <line>College boosters putting
pressure on you, or...?</line>
   <line>Coach keeps all the shady dudes away.</line>
   <line>But coach can't be everywhere
at once, you know?</line>
   <line>Why you asking this stuff?</line>
   <line>Recuriting was crazy for your dad.</line>
   <line>People were trying to get to
him in all sorts of ways.</line>
   <line>And I figure it's like that for you, too.</line>
   <line>Yeah, it can be crazy.</line>
   <line>So maybe you're up against some
of the same things your dad was.</line>
   <line>Now you're saying my dad
made a shady deal?</line>
   <line>I'm not saying that.</line>
   <line>Or if he didn't make it,
that got him k*lled?</line>
   <line>Ray, I don't know what happened yet,</line>
   <line>but I want to find out for you.</line>
   <line>I thought that Berkenpass dude k*lled him.</line>
   <line>Right, he was the primary suspect.</line>
   <line>But maybe my dad got iced
over someone fixing a game,</line>
   <line>gonna play for? Over ball?</line>
   <line>Try not to guess too much, Ray.</line>
   <line>Remember, we just need to
look at all the possibilities.</line>
   <line>Never met no Billy Berkenpass.</line>
   <line>Well, he says he met you,
Big Ed, years back.</line>
   <line>Nah. / How 'bout Herman Lester?</line>
   <line>Hey, you like fedora hats, Big Ed?</line>
   <line>They look good on me.</line>
   <line>Great.</line>
   <line>You can wear one for your
mug shot, like Al Capone.</line>
   <line>Capone?</line>
   <line>You don't get chatty real quick here,</line>
   <line>I got my pal at the IRS comb
over your income taxes,</line>
   <line>Big Ed's out of business.</line>
   <line>Maybe I do remember young Herman.</line>
   <line>I was hoping.</line>
   <line>But I was better acquainted
with his Uncle Freddie.</line>
   <line>Oh, man, ay...</line>
   <line>Oh... Big Ed, thank you for coming.</line>
   <line>Only reason I'm here is
'cause you owe me five grand.</line>
   <line>Now, where is it?</line>
   <line>There's been some complications.</line>
   <line>Brother man, that is the wrong answer.</line>
   <line>Yo, but, I got the right answer.</line>
   <line>But I need one more day.</line>
   <line>See, I got a plan.
You know, it's fool proof, too.</line>
   <line>Check it out.</line>
   <line>Yeah, let it rain, Herman,
let it rain!</line>
   <line>Yo, man, you best pull out your umbrella,
cause you is getting soaked, dog.</line>
   <line>You got to give me one more day.</line>
   <line>See, Herman Lester's my nephew,
and the boy's got a lot of love for me,</line>
   <line>so, see, with tomorrow night's game</line>
   <line>I'm gonna get him
to do me a little favor.</line>
   <line>You telling me you can get that boy
to turn the state championship out?</line>
   <line>I can make it happen.</line>
   <line>Yo, Herman!</line>
   <line>Who loves you, baby?
- You do, Uncle Fred.</line>
   <line>That's what I'm talking about.</line>
   <line>Freddie had that kind of
influence over Herman?</line>
   <line>I wasn't sold.</line>
   <line>So, I paid a visit to the Berkenpass kid.</line>
   <line>How'd that go down?</line>
   <line>It didn't. And with no insurance,
I decided to sit that game out.</line>
   <line>But the way Herman played, it seemed
like Freddie did have him on a string.</line>
   <line>All I know is when it was over,
Freddie still owed me money.</line>
   <line>That must have had him running scared.</line>
   <line>Sure, but he slowed down.</line>
   <line>Maybe you've noticed Freddie
don't walk so good no more.</line>
   <line>You got some riding on
this Friday's game, Freddie?</line>
   <line>What do you mean?</line>
   <line>Trying to keep Ray out of playing,
so you can score some bets?</line>
   <line>Just like you tried to score off
his dad in ' . / What now?</line>
   <line>We know you asked Herman to
throw the game the night he died.</line>
   <line>Come on, now, if I did that,
why did they win, huh?</line>
   <line>Logic, Freddie. Just 'cause they won
don't mean you didn't ask him.</line>
   <line>I was in full support of
Herman's career.</line>
   <line>But you owed the money to
Big Ed Brown.</line>
   <line>I paid Big Ed. / Late. That's
why you got your knees broke.</line>
   <line>But first you tried to fix the
Tech game to cash in on it,</line>
   <line>cause you didn't want your knees broke.</line>
   <line>Who does?
- I talked to Big Ed.</line>
   <line>He told me you promised
Herman would lose that game.</line>
   <line>Why didn't you say so at the top, huh?</line>
   <line>The truth, Freddie.</line>
   <line>It wasn't my proudest moment.</line>
   <line>Herman, this is a one-time,
and one-time only thing now.</line>
   <line>I can't believe you're asking me this!
- You think I wanna be asking?</line>
   <line>I'm embarrassed, man.</line>
   <line>I can hardly look you in the eye.</line>
   <line>Can't you work this out with Big Ed?</line>
   <line>This is working it out.
Don't you get that.</line>
   <line>He's gonna hurt me,
for keeps, man, understand?</line>
   <line>Freddie...listen,
- Herman,</line>
   <line>you're gonna have everything
in this life, man.</line>
   <line>The good Lord didn't give
me the talent he gave you.</line>
   <line>That's okay, I make do...</line>
   <line>but I'm asking you, this once,
toss this dog a bone.</line>
   <line>No, I can't do it.</line>
   <line>I'm sorry, no.</line>
   <line>But when Herman played so bad that night,</line>
   <line>it looked he might come
through for you after all.</line>
   <line>Gave you hope during the whole
game right up to the buzzer.</line>
   <line>That must have pissed you off.
- No, no, no!</line>
   <line>Ungrateful kid won't step up for the
man who was a father figure to him.</line>
   <line>So maybe you're the one who
lowered the boom on Herman.</line>
   <line>That's an outrage, you saying that!</line>
   <line>What's wrong?</line>
   <line>Ray's missing.</line>
   <line>Could Ray have skipped out
on practice? / No, no, no.</line>
   <line>Ray doesn't miss practice. He
comes early, leaves late always.</line>
   <line>Maybe he just went
somewhere to clear his head.</line>
   <line>You think Billy has him?
- I'm gonna go see Billy right now.</line>
   <line>Can I come?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Hey, Freddie.</line>
   <line>Stay close.</line>
   <line>Could the timing be worse?</line>
   <line>Did Ray have somewhere he had to be?</line>
   <line>Yeah. He had visit from two
Big Ten schools tonight.</line>
   <line>What's more important here, coach?</line>
   <line>I don't expect you to
understand. / Blake.</line>
   <line>I understand a -year-old's missing.</line>
   <line>That's important.</line>
   <line>Out on the street, boss.</line>
   <line>This is craziness.</line>
   <line>My baby's all over the place
and I can't find him.</line>
   <line>He can't be far.
- I can't lose him, too.</line>
   <line>Look...</line>
   <line>Where is he?
Where's my baby?</line>
   <line>Tanya, what are you...?
- What'd you do with him?</line>
   <line>I don't know what you mean.
- Ray's been missing all afternoon.</line>
   <line>They say you watch him!</line>
   <line>Come on, Tanya.
That ain't gonna help.</line>
   <line>T, I wouldn't hurt your kid.
- How about her kid's father?</line>
   <line>I believed you, Billy.</line>
   <line>I was the one person who
didn't think you k*lled Herman.</line>
   <line>So keep believing.</line>
   <line>I wouldn't do anything to hurt you.</line>
   <line>Not then, not now.</line>
   <line>How'd you find this place?</line>
   <line>Asked some old timers.</line>
   <line>I've put up 'bout a hundred jumpers,</line>
   <line>but didn't know where the right spot was.</line>
   <line>What spot?</line>
   <line>Where he died.</line>
   <line>Do you know?</line>
   <line>The write-up said on that free throw line.</line>
   <line>For Herman Lester.</line>
   <line>You make it look easy.</line>
   <line>I'm glad you're doing this.
Finding out 'bout my dad.</line>
   <line>Yeah?</line>
   <line>Cause I never could.</line>
   <line>Asking her anything 'bout
him brings her to her knees.</line>
   <line>Your mom.</line>
   <line>I never knew him,</line>
   <line>but that don't mean I don't
wanna hear about him</line>
   <line>or find out how come he got k*lled.</line>
   <line>You gonna play tomorrow?</line>
   <line>Starting to think that
call I got was no joke.</line>
   <line>No one'll blame you
if you sit the game out.</line>
   <line>Coach will.</line>
   <line>Course, player's the last thing
Freddie wants me to do.</line>
   <line>What's in it for him?</line>
   <line>Freddie got me connected
with all the shoe companies.</line>
   <line>I go league, he gets taken care of.</line>
   <line>And you think you owe Freddie.</line>
   <line>I owe coach, too.</line>
   <line>What does he want
you to do? / College.</line>
   <line>See there's two
or three schools that want me.</line>
   <line>I thought every school wanted you.</line>
   <line>Yeah, but there's two or three
that want both me and coach.</line>
   <line>See, so if I sign that letter of intent,</line>
   <line>coach comes along,
part of a package deal.</line>
   <line>Turns out if Ray decides to go to a
certain college, Coach Lein benefits big.</line>
   <line>So, is coach aiming to take the same
ride on Herman's back years ago?</line>
   <line>And how badly did he want it?</line>
   <line>Maybe the gambling angle
isn't the answer.</line>
   <line>Did Herman ever say where
he was going to school?</line>
   <line>No one knew.</line>
   <line>There was a new rumor
every day: Kansas, Iowa, Duke...</line>
   <line>She'd probably know.</line>
   <line>Sorry, boss.</line>
   <line>Don't let this change the investigation.</line>
   <line>Thank you for finding him. / Sure.</line>
   <line>Tanya, had Herman made a decision
about where he was going to college?</line>
   <line>Temple. He was gonna
announce it the next day.</line>
   <line>The Owls head coach is John Chaney.</line>
   <line>He's always run a clean program.
He does not to do "favors".</line>
   <line>So maybe Coach wanted
Herman to go somewhere else...</line>
   <line>where they did do "favors".</line>
   <line>Coach wanted him down in Florida.</line>
   <line>Temple's not the place.</line>
   <line>I've already made up my mind, coach.</line>
   <line>You'll end up at the wrong program,
you get lost in the shuffle.</line>
   <line>Doesn't matter how talented you are.</line>
   <line>Down in Florida, I can look out for you.</line>
   <line>I got responsibilities here.
- What do you mean?</line>
   <line>Tanya's pregnant.</line>
   <line>Okay, so Tanya comes, too.
- No, it's no good.</line>
   <line>What? / No!</line>
   <line>Damn it, Herman,
we need to stay together.</line>
   <line>This is my shot, too!
Haven't I always been there for you?</line>
   <line>So, Coach finds out things aren't
going the way he wants them to.</line>
   <line>Six hours before Herman dies.</line>
   <line>John.</line>
   <line>You saved the day, finding Ray.
- Talk to her.</line>
   <line>You get those college meetings
rescheduled, coach?</line>
   <line>It's plan "B", if Ray doesn't play tonight.</line>
   <line>But I know he will.</line>
   <line>You're counting on it, aren't you?</line>
   <line>Whatever you say, Missy.</line>
   <line>I think this room's got the
wrong population, boss.</line>
   <line>Lots of opinions from that one.</line>
   <line>Blake, the last hours we've been
looking at you for Herman's m*rder.</line>
   <line>You kiddin' me?</line>
   <line>When Herman broke the news
that he was going to Temple,</line>
   <line>I know you had a lot on the line.</line>
   <line>He was hurting your future.</line>
   <line>John, we're friends.</line>
   <line>We're going to hear you out
one way or another, Blake.</line>
   <line>It's better if you and I do it here and now.</line>
   <line>Now, I know you got a deep drive.</line>
   <line>All of us got one somewhere,</line>
   <line>and it will either make you
a winner, or take you down.</line>
   <line>I need you to make a gut check here, pal.</line>
   <line>Me and Herman...</line>
   <line>we had a moment of truth.</line>
   <line>You been in here the
whole time? / Yeah.</line>
   <line>Trying to wait me out like
I'd just go home?</line>
   <line>Don't you walk away from me.</line>
   <line>Hey!</line>
   <line>Coach!</line>
   <line>You think you can just go,
after all I've done for you?</line>
   <line>You won us a state
championship tonight,</line>
   <line>I'm standing here crying the blues.</line>
   <line>That's pretty piss poor.</line>
   <line>Good luck at Temple, son.</line>
   <line>I never saw Herman again.</line>
   <line>Okay, thanks.</line>
   <line>Prints from the City Center Rec
pay phone came in.</line>
   <line>Guess who we got a match on?</line>
   <line>Berkenpass?</line>
   <line>His father.</line>
   <line>What's the big deal?</line>
   <line>So, I made a call.</line>
   <line>Get off my property.</line>
   <line>Not just a call,
a "t*rror1st threat".</line>
   <line>Come on.</line>
   <line>No joke. So I were you,
I'd put that wood down.</line>
   <line>Why use the phone at the Rec?</line>
   <line>You and your son dream that up together?</line>
   <line>My son didn't know I was there.
- Noontime he was in the gym.</line>
   <line>You telling me you two didn't cross paths?</line>
   <line>We never do.
We got no relationship.</line>
   <line>Why's that?</line>
   <line>Billy wasn't athletic,</line>
   <line>he had no foot speed to talk about,</line>
   <line>so we made him a sh**t.</line>
   <line>Developed the purest stroke
you'd ever want to see.</line>
   <line>It didn't happen overnight. I'd feed
them and feed them and feed them</line>
   <line>and there wasn't a night that we left
that gym without him hitting in a row.</line>
   <line>What's that have to do with
you not having a realtionship?</line>
   <line>He quit on me.</line>
   <line>What, you don't tell me what happened?</line>
   <line>You just let me show up at the game!</line>
   <line>I was embarrassed.</line>
   <line>Son, if you would've told me,
I would've helped.</line>
   <line>But now it doesn't matter if it's not true
because the word's out, you're a bad seed.</line>
   <line>I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>Up, up, up. Chin up.</line>
   <line>Listen, we may not get more
than a junior college offer,</line>
   <line>but two years,
we're right back on track.</line>
   <line>Dad, it's over! I'm done!</line>
   <line>Don't let this break your spirit.</line>
   <line>I'm not, dad. I don't care
about being on track!</line>
   <line>I just want playing ball
to be fun again.</line>
   <line>Fun?</line>
   <line>Billy, you go home
and you get your suitcase</line>
   <line>and when you're done having fun
and you come back and you see me!</line>
   <line>Billy never plays organized ball again,
you draw a line through his name?</line>
   <line>We do what we do.</line>
   <line>Now and then I'll go back and
watch him sh**t at the Rec.</line>
   <line>Those are old wounds.</line>
   <line>So why all of a sudden
make this call to Ray?</line>
   <line>Now, leaving the Rec that day,
seeing Ray Lester's face splattered all over</line>
   <line>like these people are the First Family
of Basketball or something</line>
   <line>that nonsense had to stop once and for all.</line>
   <line>We got to arrest you for making that threat.</line>
   <line>Hey, for crying out loud.
- Come on.</line>
   <line>You got to come with us.</line>
   <line>Prints were in the system 'cause
of a bar brawl three years back.</line>
   <line>I talked to the guy that
got beat down by him.</line>
   <line>Said it all started 'cause the barflies were
talking about the late great Herman Lester.</line>
   <line>years later and he's
still smarting over that?</line>
   <line>This guy's got deep feelings
about his son not playing ball.</line>
   <line>Disowned him over it.
- Maybe k*lled over it.</line>
   <line>Problem is, the Berkenpass
alibi goes both ways.</line>
   <line>Covers Billy but also covers the dad.
- Ah, Senior won't give it up.</line>
   <line>So work on Junior.</line>
   <line>We just need some last questions
answered, then we'll leave you alone.</line>
   <line>We got a new suspect, Billy.</line>
   <line>Good for you.</line>
   <line>Need the straight story on
your alibi. / Straight story?</line>
   <line>You were in your car?
sh**ting hoops?</line>
   <line>Doesn't matter we just got to
hear where you really were.</line>
   <line>Watching  TV with my dad.</line>
   <line>Maybe we got to level with Billy.</line>
   <line>He's gonna find out anyway.</line>
   <line>Pops put the death threat on Ray.</line>
   <line>My dad?</line>
   <line>You surprised?</line>
   <line>Cause you look surprised.</line>
   <line>But the funny thing is,
you look it and you don't.</line>
   <line>My guess is, you never knew
your dad k*lled Herman either.</line>
   <line>But, right now in this moment...</line>
   <line>you do.</line>
   <line>Cause you and dad never
watched TV that night.</line>
   <line>Can I just go now?</line>
   <line>Sure. We'll walk you out.</line>
   <line>Ray's just taking care of some paperwork.</line>
   <line>Hey, you want to meet him,
Billy? / No, thanks.</line>
   <line>Yeah, we keep arguing over
whether he looks like his pops or not.</line>
   <line>He does... a little.</line>
   <line>Yeah, but the difference is,
Ray's walking away from the game.</line>
   <line>W-Walking away? / He's mixed
up about how his dad died.</line>
   <line>Figures Herman made a wrong decision
and maybe that's what k*lled him.</line>
   <line>Why's he think that?</line>
   <line>He didn't know anything about his dad.</line>
   <line>Looks like another Lester
won't reach his potential.</line>
   <line>Maybe I-I will say hi to him.</line>
   <line>Sure.</line>
   <line>Hey, kid.</line>
   <line>I want to tell you something about him.</line>
   <line>And that night.</line>
   <line>I wasn't at home with my dad.</line>
   <line>I-I was with Herman.</line>
   <line>Got to hand it to you.</line>
   <line>Only Herman Lester can play ball that bad
and still get carried off the court like a king.</line>
   <line>Final score's all that counts.</line>
   <line>Keep telling yourself that.</line>
   <line>You think I tried to
throw the game tonight?</line>
   <line>Yeah, I do.
- You're wrong.</line>
   <line>Then why did you play like a buster?</line>
   <line>You.</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>Everybody thinks I'm this one-man show.</line>
   <line>But it's you that gets me
the ball in the paint.</line>
   <line>When I'm double-teamed,
you always hit the J.</line>
   <line>But you weren't there tonight.</line>
   <line>Billy...</line>
   <line>we haven't been friends...</line>
   <line>but we've been a team, right?</line>
   <line>Your dad was stand-up.</line>
   <line>There was all this junk around us,
everyone trying to make us enemies.</line>
   <line>But he-he jsut followed his instincts...</line>
   <line>and they were good.</line>
   <line>The man was good.</line>
   <line>We talked to your boy Billy,
Mr. Berkenpass.</line>
   <line>He burned your alibi.</line>
   <line>Why would he do that?</line>
   <line>Cause he didn't k*ll Herman Lester.</line>
   <line>You did.</line>
   <line>Billy said that?</line>
   <line>Want us to bring him in here?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>It was always awkward
for Billy and me.</line>
   <line>Basketball was the way
that I could be his dad, see?</line>
   <line>That was our whole relationship.</line>
   <line>That night when I told Billy
to pack his bags, I...</line>
   <line>I wanted to take it back.</line>
   <line>Why didn't you?</line>
   <line>I followed after him.</line>
   <line>Wound up at Player's Park...</line>
   <line>and I watched Herman and Billy.</line>
   <line>I watched them shaking hands.</line>
   <line>That wasn't a good thing?</line>
   <line>That was him giving up.</line>
   <line>I knew that he wasn't gonna play again.</line>
   <line>That was the end of one thing
that we had in common.</line>
   <line>Oh, hey, Mr.B.</line>
   <line>You're looking for Billy,
you just missed him.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Think he said he was headed home.</line>
   <line>Then I guess I'll see him there, then.</line>
   <line>Are you okay, sir?
You, uh... look a little off.</line>
   <line>Good game tonight.</line>
