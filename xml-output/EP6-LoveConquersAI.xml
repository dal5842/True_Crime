   <line>Depends on what you did.</line>
   <line>Ricky was the driver in a Fishtown

   <line>Paige Pratt.</line>
   <line>Keep going.</line>
   <line>I ain't saying
I saw the b*llet leave the g*n,</line>
   <line>but I did see something good.</line>
   <line>I was working at this
auto repair shop back then.</line>
   <line>Had the keys,</line>
   <line>so I was gonna sneak in.</line>
   <line>The youngest kid Will,</line>
   <line>he was already there.</line>
   <line type="music">♪ Who can it be knocking at my door? ♪</line>

   <line>Will Harrell must have k*lled her.</line>
   <line>Are you trying to get a deal off of that?</line>
   <line>It's good information.</line>
   <line>It's crap. / Valens,</line>
   <line>remember our angle.</line>
   <line>Okay.</line>
   <line>She was years old?</line>
   <line>Yeah, real pretty.
Track star.</line>
   <line>She had a future.</line>
   <line>Why didn't you say
anything back then, Ricky?</line>
   <line>I was going to the shop
that night to steal some stuff.</line>
   <line>Not gonna explain that. / Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line>Okay, I'll check it out.</line>
   <line>Hey, it's gonna get me
out of hot water, right?</line>
   <line>We'll see how this pans out.</line>
   <line>He-Here's the other part.</line>
   <line>Someone else went down for this.
- Yeah?</line>
   <line>Yeah. Some mope named Al Clarkson.</line>
   <line>He's doing life.</line>
   <line>Unsolved is upstairs.
The closed ones are down here.</line>
   <line>Cold cases...I don't know.</line>
   <line>I like being out on the street.</line>
   <line>Paige died in a field near the Schuykill River.</line>
   <line>So, what, I work a few of these,
then go on the line?</line>
   <line>You act like this is
the B assignment, Scotty.</line>
   <line>Ain't it?</line>
   <line>Not to me.</line>
   <line>I chose it.</line>
   <line>Three blows to the head</line>
   <line>that would have k*lled her
even if she hadn't been shot.</line>
   <line>Passion crime.
Someone she knew.</line>
   <line>Al Clarkson was her boyfriend,
convicted in ' .</line>
   <line>Commonwealth must've had a case.</line>
   <line>Lots of testimony he had a temper.</line>
   <line>That's nothing.</line>
   <line>His gold chain was found
at the scene. / Better.</line>
   <line>Tracks matched the tires on his Nova.</line>
   <line>Goodrich TA Radial or
Uniroyal Tiger Paw?</line>
   <line>Uniroyal. How'd you know that?</line>
   <line>It's a popular tire upgrade
on a muscle car like that.</line>
   <line>You know a lot about cars?</line>
   <line>Everything.</line>
   <line>So this Will Harrell that saw
Ricky cleaning blood out of his car...?</line>
   <line>What kind of ride he have?</line>
   <line>Trans AM.</line>
   <line>Could have easily had
those same tires.</line>
   <line>So it could have been
his car at the scene.</line>
   <line>All right. This snitch's story starts to
gets some credibility.</line>
   <line>Plus a head injury means
a lot of blood,</line>
   <line>found near Paige's body.</line>
   <line>So she did most of her
bleeding somewhere else.</line>
   <line>Like inside a car.</line>
   <line>So why do you like old jobs?</line>
   <line>You don't like the action?</line>
   <line>Don't like b*stards
getting away with m*rder.</line>
   <line>Will Harrell?</line>
   <line>You remember a guy
named Rick Stockvis,</line>
   <line>used to work here?</line>
   <line>There's a name I'd rather forget.</line>
   <line>Why's that?</line>
   <line>Guy was a thief.</line>
   <line>He was lifting our tools,
hocking'em.</line>
   <line>We're checking a story he told us</line>
   <line>your Trans AM, June , .</line>
   <line>That's pretty specific.</line>
   <line>It was the same night
a girl named Paige Pratt died.</line>
   <line>No, that didn't happen.
- Did you know Paige?</line>
   <line>No. / Friend of the family, church?</line>
   <line>I just said that I didn't know her.</line>
   <line>You sold that car pretty soon
after her death.</line>
   <line>According to VIN records,
it was just six days later.</line>
   <line>I wanted the new ZX.</line>
   <line>What kind of tires were
you sporting, Will?</line>
   <line>Factory install or upgrade?</line>
   <line>I don't recall.</line>
   <line>Well, that's what records are for.</line>
   <line>Mind if we sit in your office,
look through your paperwork?</line>
   <line>Yes, I do.
I'm very busy.</line>
   <line>Will got pretty hinky
near the end there.</line>
   <line>Make any connect
between him and Paige?</line>
   <line>No. Went to different high schools.</line>
   <line>That age, high school's
your whole world.</line>
   <line>Still looking for her parents.
They're not at their old address.</line>
   <line>You Valens? / Yeah.</line>
   <line>Will Jeffries. Congratulations.</line>
   <line>Thanks. It's great being here.</line>
   <line>Jeffries and Vera are a matching set.</line>
   <line>Someone named Roxy
called for you.</line>
   <line>Yeah? Good.</line>
   <line>Twice. Says she'll try you back.</line>
   <line>Yeah. She don't got a phone.</line>
   <line>You guys get a job?</line>
   <line>Confession at the scene.
Total duck.</line>
   <line>You wanna track
this old Trans AM for us?</line>
   <line>See if it's still on the street somewhere?</line>
   <line>Sure thing. Lil, you might
wanna go see Al Clarkson.</line>
   <line>Get his view of the world.</line>
   <line>You know, it'd be good to find
the second owner on it.</line>
   <line>Whoever bought it from Harrell.</line>
   <line>Thanks.
We'll do that.</line>
   <line>You could learn something
from this guy.</line>
   <line>I bought that Trans AM in .</line>
   <line>Yeah, I got a car habit.</line>
   <line>Mercedes taste on a Mazda salary.</line>
   <line>I hear you.</line>
   <line>So, did you break the bank
on that TA?</line>
   <line>Nah, that was a steal.</line>
   <line>Dumb kid didn't know what it was worth.</line>
   <line>I sold it for twice what I paid.</line>
   <line>Why'd he sell it so cheap?</line>
   <line>I didn't ask.</line>
   <line>A good deal falls in your lap,
you take it.</line>
   <line>Do you remember anything
about the kid you bought it from?</line>
   <line>Well, just that he kept
the car up pretty good.</line>
   <line>Seemed to love it,</line>
   <line>but still, he was selling.</line>
   <line>Look, my boss is
giving me the evil eye.</line>
   <line>Mind if we finish our coffee?</line>
   <line>Nah, live it up.</line>
   <line>So Will worked at an auto shop.</line>
   <line>He never heard
about Blue Book value?</line>
   <line>Motivated seller maybe.</line>
   <line>West Detectives was all
about the volume.</line>
   <line>Every night it's hoppin'.</line>
   <line>You're out there running
your whole shift.</line>
   <line>That's why I'm saying,</line>
   <line>I just don't know if cold cases
is gonna be my thing.</line>
   <line>And I just don't know
if you have a choice, Scotty.</line>
   <line>What do you want with me?</line>
   <line>Looking into your case again, Al.</line>
   <line>Lock him up and throw away
the key." That was my case.</line>
   <line>Well, we're looking at it again.</line>
   <line>I didn't k*ll Paige.</line>
   <line>I got railroaded because I was
hanging with a high school girl.</line>
   <line>Those guys are a little creepy, Al.</line>
   <line>I was a late bloomer.</line>
   <line>I see Rudy Tanner was your lawyer.</line>
   <line>Strip mall hack.</line>
   <line>One of them guys in bad clothes,</line>
   <line>dropping his folders
all over the place?</line>
   <line>That's him. / I didn't know
how to find someone good.</line>
   <line>How do you explain your gold
chainbeing at the crime scene, Al?</line>
   <line>Paige was wearing it.
- She wear it a lot?</line>
   <line>When we were getting along.</line>
   <line>A lot of people say you had
a real temper with her.</line>
   <line>She ran wild on me.
I loved her, so it hurt.</line>
   <line>Jealousy ain't against the law.</line>
   <line>How come you weren't
with her that night?</line>
   <line>She was supposed to be grounded,
but she must've snuck out.</line>
   <line>Energetic girl.</line>
   <line>Yeah, she was.</line>
   <line>My guess is she must've
met some guy.</line>
   <line>She had someone
on her mind around that time...</line>
   <line>What am I missing, Paige?
You're here to run.</line>
   <line>Why you gotta wear
purple eye shadow?</line>
   <line>I can race and look good. / Uh-huh.</line>
   <line>Which one is he?</line>
   <line>I'm tired of the third degree, Al.
- And I'm tired of being your fool.</line>
   <line>Who is he?</line>
   <line>Maybe you should just leave.</line>
   <line>I'll get my own ride home.</line>
   <line>So which one was he?</line>
   <line>Never found out.</line>
   <line>Think it could have been this guy?</line>
   <line>Will Harrell?</line>
   <line>Nah, I never saw him.</line>
   <line>Okay, thanks for your time, Al.</line>
   <line>Yeah. Go pound sand.</line>
   <line>You can just take my car?</line>
   <line>Don't worry, kid.</line>
   <line>We'll get it back to you
when we're done.</line>
   <line>There's a dance Friday night.
Will I have it back by then?</line>
   <line>We'll do our best.</line>
   <line>Yeah, 'cause I just bought this.
I've only had it for, like, two weeks.</line>
   <line>First car, huh?</line>
   <line>Friday, right?</line>
   <line>Hope he's got insurance.</line>
   <line>Oh, he don't.</line>
   <line>Upholstery could've been
shampooed times,</line>
   <line>we're still gonna know
if blood was shed in there.</line>
   <line>Figure out a Will and Paige connect?</line>
   <line>She was an athlete at Crespi.
He was a loser at Jefferson.</line>
   <line>No activities in common.</line>
   <line>So maybe Willy's hanging
around the wawa one night,</line>
   <line>looking for a party...</line>
   <line>Yeah. He's got the car going for him.</line>
   <line>Paige needs a ride.
- He's a little mole.</line>
   <line>Doesn't do good with girls.
Makes a play for her.</line>
   <line>She brushes him off.</line>
   <line>Will breaks her head open.</line>
   <line>This is the cool part.</line>
   <line>Hit the light.</line>
   <line>He knew her somehow.</line>
   <line>Found your old Trans AM, Will.</line>
   <line>Blood, blood, and more blood.</line>
   <line>Bull.</line>
   <line>Wanna see pictures?</line>
   <line>Okay. Just...</line>
   <line>Here's what happened.</line>
   <line>I... hit a dog on the Turnpike.</line>
   <line>A dog.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I...I put it in my car.
I had to clean it out after.</line>
   <line>That's what Ricky must have seen.</line>
   <line>You a special kind of stupid, Will?</line>
   <line>I'm not making it up.</line>
   <line>And the night that girl was m*rder*d,</line>
   <line>I was at Raiders of the Lost Ark.</line>
   <line>You recall that now, too, huh?</line>
   <line>You guys coming around
made me think of it.</line>
   <line>Who'd you see the movie with?</line>
   <line>Bennett Cahill.
My best friend.</line>
   <line>And...And his girlfriend Jane.</line>
   <line>I have cheer practice till : .</line>
   <line>So when can we talk?</line>
   <line>Dinner at : .</line>
   <line>So I should call you at : ?</line>
   <line>Hey, guys.</line>
   <line>Hey.</line>
   <line>I'm seeing Raiders tomorrow.</line>
   <line>Cool.</line>
   <line>Yeah. I'm getting in line at noon.</line>
   <line>I'll get three tickets,
if you guys wanna go.</line>
   <line>Yeah, sounds good.</line>
   <line>Okay, great. Saturday...</line>
   <line>Raiders.</line>
   <line>I still have the ticket stub to prove it.</line>
   <line>You have the stub from years ago?</line>
   <line>Some good luck.</line>
   <line>It's my favorite movies.</line>
   <line>You keep stuff like that.</line>
   <line>Well, you do realize
that we have the science</line>
   <line>to tell us the difference between
dog and human blood, right?</line>
   <line>I have the ticket stub.</line>
   <line>You and Bennett still close?</line>
   <line>Bennett's really successful.
Always was.</line>
   <line>Class president, went to Princeton.</line>
   <line>He's a surgeon now.</line>
   <line>You're friends with a surgeon?</line>
   <line>Old friends.</line>
   <line>Okay, Will, we'll check out that story.</line>
   <line>I have the stub.</line>
   <line>So what happened
to your old partner?</line>
   <line>Detailed out to H.I.U.</line>
   <line>Gotta weed out the weak ones.</line>
   <line>He needed all day work
'cause of his diabates.</line>
   <line>He wasn't... weak.</line>
   <line>Hi. Bennett Cahill.</line>
   <line>Detectives Rush and Valens,
Homicide.</line>
   <line>What's it about?</line>
   <line>Guy named Will Harrell.</line>
   <line>You went to high school together.</line>
   <line>I could probably place him.</line>
   <line>Right, that guy.</line>
   <line>What'd he do?
- We don't know yet.</line>
   <line>Will says you and him
were best friends.</line>
   <line>More like acquaintances.</line>
   <line>He says you went to Raiders
of the Lost Ark</line>
   <line>June , .</line>
   <line>I doubt it.</line>
   <line>I probably was with Jane,
but, uh, Will...?</line>
   <line>Willy kind of an outcast type?</line>
   <line>You could say.</line>
   <line>He had this room at his dad's shop.</line>
   <line>It was a no-parents zone, you know?</line>
   <line>So a lot of us would hang out there,
drink beer, whatever.</line>
   <line>How'd he do with the ladies?</line>
   <line>Don't recall any big scores.</line>
   <line>He ever mention a girl named Paige?</line>
   <line>No. But we didn't talk a lot.</line>
   <line>Uh...</line>
   <line>After he freaked me out one night,
I stopped going over there.</line>
   <line>What'd he do?</line>
   <line>He showed me a g*n.</line>
   <line>Called it a b*tch k*ller.</line>
   <line>Yeah. That's when I stopped
going over there.</line>
   <line>Will seem like he could get
frustrated enough to hurt a girl?</line>
   <line>I really don't know.</line>
   <line>Uh... I hope not.</line>
   <line>Will was a B-list kid
with A-list aspirations.</line>
   <line>Hottie like Paige would
have blown him off for sure.</line>
   <line>He meets her, gets the snub,
it's the last straw.</line>
   <line>Pulls out his b*tch k*ller.</line>
   <line>His what?</line>
   <line>Nothing, boss.</line>
   <line>Did you ever find Paige's parents?</line>
   <line>Mm. Moved to Atlanta in ' .</line>
   <line>Aren't returning phone calls.</line>
   <line>They already got some in jail.
Why relieve the nightmare?</line>
   <line>DA's office is gonna hate this.</line>
   <line>Well, Kite's already called
a hundred times.</line>
   <line>Who't Kite?</line>
   <line>Assistant D.A. Ivy League jerk.</line>
   <line>Criminalistics just called.</line>
   <line>It was Paige's blood in the Trans AM.</line>
   <line>You can't do this.</line>
   <line>Sure we can.
Read the search warrant.</line>
   <line>I'm telling you I hit a dog.</line>
   <line>Well, that dog had Paige Pratt's DNA.</line>
   <line>Look. Look.</line>
   <line>Look at the date.
Look at the date.</line>
   <line>June , .
- Heads up.</line>
   <line>Found the b*tch k*ller.</line>
   <line>I've never seen that before in my life.</line>
   <line>My money says this is
the g*n k*lled Paige.</line>
   <line>Party's over, Will.</line>
   <line>I was with Bennett and
Jane that night!</line>
   <line>Yeah, we talked to Bennett.</line>
   <line>He didn't back your story.</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>Your "best friend"
barely remembered you, Willy.</line>
   <line>He said you were a nobody in hight school.</line>
   <line>A hanger-on who got used
by the popular kids</line>
   <line>cause you gave them a place to party.</line>
   <line>He didn't say that.</line>
   <line>He said he wouldn't be seen
at the movies with you.</line>
   <line>Or anywhere else.</line>
   <line>Well, then...</line>
   <line>Then screw him.</line>
   <line>You wanna know the truth?</line>
   <line>For a change, you mean?</line>
   <line>We were supposed to go
to the movies that night.</line>
   <line>But he asked me to borrow
my car at first.</line>
   <line>Where the hell have you been?</line>
   <line>There was a problem.</line>
   <line>Is that... is that blood?</line>
   <line>I, uh, I hit a dog.</line>
   <line>You and Jane?
- No, it was just me, uh...</line>
   <line>Uh...</line>
   <line>I tried to save it.
I took it to the vet.</line>
   <line>It bled all over the seats.</line>
   <line>You should have called me.
- Yeah...</line>
   <line>Well, upholstery's gonna
need to be cleaned out.</line>
   <line>I'll do it.</line>
   <line>Will...</line>
   <line>we went to Raiders, okay?</line>
   <line>I don't want my mom
knowing about the dog.</line>
   <line>No...</line>
   <line>Sure. / Thanks, pal.</line>
   <line>Dumb-a*s story, Willy.</line>
   <line>It's true. / Yeah.</line>
   <line>I loaned Bennett my car.</line>
   <line>He...He must have k*lled that girl.</line>
   <line>And...and then put the g*n in the ceiling.</line>
   <line>Then why'd you cover for him?</line>
   <line>Me and Bennett had
a deal not to talk about it.</line>
   <line>And...</line>
   <line>I...I thought we were friends.</line>
   <line>Hey, are we gonna do this?</line>
   <line>Just a sec.</line>
   <line>You owe me a call, Rush.</line>
   <line>I was getting to that today.</line>
   <line>There's a difference between
cold cases and closed cases.</line>
   <line>Do you get my meaning?</line>
   <line>You agreed to the deal with
that snitch.</line>
   <line>No one mentioned his information
was on a case we already won.</line>
   <line>Okay, then, we should just ignore
the DNA and ballistics, huh?</line>
   <line>Am I supposed to go to my boss
and say,</line>
   <line>Sorry, you screwed the pooch
on this one.</line>
   <line>We're just gonna star over."?</line>
   <line>And innocent man's
been sitting in jail</line>
   <line>for years because of your boss.</line>
   <line>Why don't you tell him that?</line>
   <line>I don't spring Al Clarkson
untill you arrest Harrell.</line>
   <line>I'm holding him.</line>
   <line>I want him arrested.</line>
   <line>I want to give it a day. / No.</line>
   <line>Okay, then, well...</line>
   <line>Will's locked up.</line>
   <line>Who's that charmer?</line>
   <line>ADA Kite.</line>
   <line>He's above cops.</line>
   <line>Ain't above checking you out.</line>
   <line>I thought you had your guy, Lil.</line>
   <line>I'm gonna check out Will's story.</line>
   <line>Go through it all again,
this time with Bennett in mind.</line>
   <line>Don't matter that
everything points to Will?</line>
   <line>Al Clarkson got screwed
'cause the prosecutors</line>
   <line>didn't look at all the angles.</line>
   <line>I'm not doing that to Will.</line>
   <line>So, you looking for
a Bennett-Paige connect?</line>
   <line>Yeah. / Well...</line>
   <line>Here. Bennett was
the captain of his track team.</line>
   <line>Paige ran track for her school.</line>
   <line>They could have met that way.</line>
   <line>And Al thought she was flirting with
someone at a track meet, remember?</line>
   <line>Now something's cooking.</line>
   <line>Just a month before.</line>
   <line>We going back to the doc?</line>
   <line>No, let's go to the girlfriend
he was supposedly with that night</line>
   <line>Jane.</line>
   <line>You guys keep reading.</line>
   <line>Sure.</line>
   <line>Then we'll wash your car.</line>
   <line>We have some questions
about Bennett Cahill.</line>
   <line>Did something happen to him?</line>
   <line>Nah. Alive and kicking.</line>
   <line>He was your high school
boyfriend, right?</line>
   <line>All four years.
- Pretty serious?</line>
   <line>Very. But, uh, then we wentto
different colleges, lost touch...</line>
   <line>Either of you date anyone else
in high school?</line>
   <line>No. No, we were together.</line>
   <line>So there wasn't a girl named
Paige Pratt in your lives?</line>
   <line>She went to Crespi.</line>
   <line>Ran track, like Bennett.</line>
   <line>I know who you're talking about,</line>
   <line>because of what happened to her.</line>
   <line>But we didn't know her.</line>
   <line>You and Bennett knew
all the same people?</line>
   <line>Why are you asking about this?</line>
   <line>Someone was convicted of that crime.</line>
   <line>He's been unconvicted.</line>
   <line>And what do you want from me?</line>
   <line>I don't suppose you remember
what you were doing June , .</line>
   <line>Of course she doesn't.</line>
   <line>Actually, I do.</line>
   <line>For good reason.</line>
   <line>Are you sure you're ready for this?</line>
   <line>I'm sure.</line>
   <line>You know, we don't have to.</line>
   <line>I want to.</line>
   <line>We love each other, and...</line>
   <line>if we're gonna take it to the next level...</line>
   <line>First time, huh?</line>
   <line>Sweet.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>His first time, too?</line>
   <line>We were devoted to each other.</line>
   <line>So that's a yes?</line>
   <line>That's a yes.</line>
   <line>You ain't covering for Bennett
all this time later, are you Jane?</line>
   <line>Bennett Cahill was an angel.</line>
   <line>Angel"...yeesh.</line>
   <line>You wanna write up her interview?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>While you're at it,
you gotta redo Clarkson's.</line>
   <line>What do you mean?</line>
   <line>Uh, you wrote it in the third person.
It's gotta be in their words.</line>
   <line>Rush!
We got goods.</line>
   <line>Yeah?
- Loot at this.</line>
   <line>Three pages of blah, blah, blah,</line>
   <line>says to Paige at the end.</line>
   <line>Forget the A, go for the B."</line>
   <line>Yeah. Could be grades,
could be Al and Bennett.</line>
   <line>Not bad. / Mm.</line>
   <line>Probably wrote it that way
in case Al ever read it.</line>
   <line>Who's Heidi?</line>
   <line>Tracking her down.</line>
   <line>I'll go you one better.</line>
   <line>Surveillance pictures of
Al Clarkson before his arrest.</line>
   <line>These were taken
at Paige's memorial service.</line>
   <line>What's Bennett doing there?</line>
   <line>I have surgery in ten minutes.
Can we make this brief, please?</line>
   <line>Sure.</line>
   <line>What were you doing Paige Pratt?</line>
   <line>I didn't even know her.</line>
   <line>You just like memorial services?</line>
   <line>Feel like I'm again.</line>
   <line>Huh.</line>
   <line>I guess there's no reason to lie now.</line>
   <line>I did know Paige...</line>
   <line>for about an hour.</line>
   <line>Call me when you get home?</line>
   <line>The very moment.</line>
   <line type="music">♪ Her hair is Harlow gold, ♪</line>
   <line type="music">♪ Her lips sweet surprise ♪</line>
   <line type="music">♪ Her hands are never cold, ♪</line>

   <line>Hi.</line>
   <line>Did you miss your ride?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Can you believe it?</line>
   <line>How far do you live?</line>
   <line>Not that far.
Six miles.</line>
   <line>I can pay you for gas.</line>
   <line type="music">♪ And she'll tease you,
she'll unease you ♪</line>
   <line type="music">♪ All the better just to please you ♪</line>
   <line type="music">♪ She's precocious,

   <line>I've always noticed you.</line>
   <line>I look for you at all the meets.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I've seen you, too.</line>
   <line>What did you think?</line>
   <line>I thought I gotta meet that girl.</line>
   <line>It was a stupid...</line>
   <line>a stupid thing to do.</line>
   <line>I... I had a girlfriend.</line>
   <line>This was the girl that I was gonna
spend the rest of my life with.</line>
   <line>Yeah, but she wasn't providing.</line>
   <line>I dropped Paige at home
never saw her again.</line>
   <line>The only one who ever
existed to me was Jane.</line>
   <line>But after Paige died,
you felt guilty.</line>
   <line>That's why I went to the service.</line>
   <line>Did Jane know about this?</line>
   <line>Jane and I had an epic love.</line>
   <line>She couldn't know about it.</line>
   <line>It would've k*lled her.</line>
   <line>You talked to Janie lately?</line>
   <line>Breaking up was so awful, we, uh...</line>
   <line>we knew we could
never speak again.</line>
   <line>Was Paige's best friend,</line>
   <line>you must've known about her love life.</line>
   <line>Paige had a huge crush
on Bennett.</line>
   <line>But he was a senior at Jefferson,
and very taken.</line>
   <line>By Jane.</line>
   <line>Was she a b*tch.</line>
   <line>Yeah? Why?</line>
   <line>Well, when she found out about</line>
   <line>Paige and Bennett doing it
that one time...</line>
   <line>she kept calling Paige up</line>
   <line>and saying "You're a damn sl*t"
and all this...</line>
   <line>How do you know it was Jane?</line>
   <line>Well, she was head
cheerleader at Jefferson</line>
   <line>I knew her squeaky little voice.</line>
   <line>So you didn't tell the cops about this.</line>
   <line>It didn't seem important.</line>
   <line>Al was such a slime bag,
we all just thought he did it.</line>
   <line>Did Paige ever see Bennett again?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>Track season was over.</line>
   <line>She was still hung up on him, though.</line>
   <line>Wrote me all these notes about him...</line>
   <line>Mm... You still have any
of those notes?</line>
   <line>No. I wish I did.</line>
   <line>Is it true that Al didn't k*ll her?</line>
   <line>Looks that way.</line>
   <line>That's a wasted life, huh?</line>
   <line>Bennett and Jane supposedly had
this epic love...</line>
   <line>huh...till Bennett cheats.</line>
   <line>He says Janie didn't know,</line>
   <line>Paige to tell her off.</line>
   <line>So Bennett could've done it
to shut Paige up</line>
   <line>or Jane could've done
it out of revenge.</line>
   <line>And poor Will's sitting in lockup.</line>
   <line>Not a good time</line>
   <line>Complicated social life.</line>
   <line>So what's with the origami?</line>
   <line>Letters from Paige to her best friend.</line>
   <line>Full of dirty details about Bennett.</line>
   <line>Uh-huh.</line>
   <line>Here's another one.</line>
   <line>A little more loopy with the letters.</line>
   <line>How do I get stuck doing this?</line>
   <line>I'm doing the fancy folding.</line>
   <line>We're in the middle of dinner.</line>
   <line>We gotta talk about Bennett and Paige.</line>
   <line>What about them?</line>
   <line>Come on now, Jane.</line>
   <line>It was a one-time thing.
- Is that what he told you?</line>
   <line>He begged my forgiveness.
We moved past it.</line>
   <line>But Bennett wasn't a virgin anymore.</line>
   <line>That must've hurt.</line>
   <line>It was a one-time thing.</line>
   <line>Not according to these.</line>
   <line>Paige wrote these notes
to her friend Heidi.</line>
   <line>They're all about Bennett
and the nine times she was with him.</line>
   <line>I, um...</line>
   <line>highlighted the good parts.</line>
   <line>She was a liar.</line>
   <line>And a sl*t, right?</line>
   <line>Like you told her on the phone?</line>
   <line>You should go.</line>
   <line>I'll just leave these for you.</line>
   <line>Still wanna stick with your story, Jane?</line>
   <line>That you and Bennett hadyour
first night, June , or...</line>
   <line>did something else
going on that night?</line>
   <line>I told you what happened.</line>
   <line>Well, I'll be meeting with Bennett
first thing tomorrow morning.</line>
   <line>Hopefully, your stories will match.</line>
   <line>How'd it go?</line>
   <line>We'll see.</line>
   <line>It was just Roxy.</line>
   <line>That the one from the other morning?</line>
   <line>Nah, that's Blair.</line>
   <line>So which one's your girl?</line>
   <line>I don't get a girl.</line>
   <line>They're, uh, contacts
on the Hammond case.</line>
   <line>I'm still looking for a guy.</line>
   <line>You know, in West,</line>
   <line>we didn't write our interviews
first person.</line>
   <line>In Homicide we do.</line>
   <line>Uh-huh.</line>
   <line>Homicide's got the best guys, Scotty.</line>
   <line>You're not gonna
be the superstar your first week.</line>
   <line>There she goes.</line>
   <line>The surgeon blowing her off?</line>
   <line>He's coming.</line>
   <line>Nice ride.</line>
   <line>Wants to show the old girlfriend
how good he did in life.</line>
   <line>Be a good time to bring'em in.</line>
   <line>You know Will Harrell's sittingin jail
right now, don't you, Bennett?</line>
   <line>Yeah... mm..</line>
   <line>and I feel bad about it.</line>
   <line>But you... you really should
be talking to Jane.</line>
   <line>Except Jane, didn't borrow
Will's car that night,</line>
   <line>where Paige's blood ended up.</line>
   <line>I borrowed it,</line>
   <line>and then let Jane take it out
with her cheerleader friends.</line>
   <line>Gosh!</line>
   <line>The new stories just keep coming.</line>
   <line>She came and told me what she did.</line>
   <line>I loved her,
so I helped clean up after.</line>
   <line>When she found out about Paige
and me, she wanted one thing.</line>
   <line>What was that?</line>
   <line>To see her dead.</line>
   <line>Get away.</line>
   <line>How could you do that?</line>
   <line>It was meaningless.</line>
   <line>I was stupid. I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>I was gonna give myself to you,</line>
   <line>and you just threw it away
on this nobody.</line>
   <line>Th...This can't ruin what we have.</line>
   <line>What we had is gone.</line>
   <line>I can't be with you now.</line>
   <line>Jane.</line>
   <line>Who is she?</line>
   <line>She was over
at Will's all the time, too.</line>
   <line>She must've hid the g*n there.</line>
   <line>She told you she k*lled her?</line>
   <line>It'll be hard for you to understand.</line>
   <line>But Jane and I had something
that most people don't.</line>
   <line>In our situation, it,
it didn't seem wrong.</line>
   <line>What situation?</line>
   <line>Love.</line>
   <line>Our was different than other people's.</line>
   <line>You said the guy was an angel.</line>
   <line>Now he's a k*ller?</line>
   <line>This was Bennett's doing.
- That's not what he says, Janie.</line>
   <line>He says you were so jealous of Paige,
you went out and shot her dead.</line>
   <line>I shot her?</line>
   <line>That's his position.</line>
   <line>He came to me, crawling...</line>
   <line>saying he'd do anything,</line>
   <line>anything...</line>
   <line>to be together again.</line>
   <line>Guess what that "anything" was?</line>
   <line>Please talk to me.</line>
   <line>We're through, Bennett.</line>
   <line>No. I have to have you back.</line>
   <line>What do you want me to do?
Name it. I'll do whatever you say.</line>
   <line>There's nothing to do.</line>
   <line>Yes, there is. I know there is,</line>
   <line>and I'll do it.</line>
   <line>He got a g*n...</line>
   <line>he took her out to a field...</line>
   <line>and got her out of our lives.</line>
   <line>Came and told me about it.</line>
   <line>And you kept that secret for him.</line>
   <line>What else could I do?</line>
   <line>Head for the hills and call the cops.</line>
   <line>I don't think you're hearing me.</line>
   <line>He loved me so much,</line>
   <line>he did m*rder for me.</line>
   <line>I've been looking through
your yearbook, Bennett.</line>
   <line>You and Janie are all over it.</line>
   <line>Best Couple."</line>
   <line>Prom king and queen?</line>
   <line>Junior and senior prom.</line>
   <line>Ah, must've been great.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Me,</line>
   <line>I can't keep a girl's attention
longer than three months.</line>
   <line>I've never been lucky in love either.</line>
   <line>I wouldn't call it "luck."</line>
   <line>Fate?</line>
   <line>That's closer.</line>
   <line>Jane and I used to say
that we were as...</line>
   <line>as Halley's Comet.</line>
   <line>That's amazing.</line>
   <line>Too bad you ruined it with
that fling with Paige.</line>
   <line>I didn't ruin it.</line>
   <line>No? How do you make up
for some like that?</line>
   <line>We figured out a way.</line>
   <line>How?</line>
   <line>I got no chance at Halley's Comet...
neither does he...</line>
   <line>so we really need you
to help us understand.</line>
   <line>We made a plan.</line>
   <line>I know what we can do.
- You do?</line>
   <line>I know how we can be togehter.</line>
   <line>Tell me.</line>
   <line>If we k*ll her, we can erase her,</line>
   <line>and then you'll be a virgin again.</line>
   <line>Yeah?</line>
   <line>It's to save us.</line>
   <line>You're right.</line>
   <line>You're right.</line>
   <line>You'll have to take my word for it.</line>
   <line>It made sense.</line>
   <line>Bennett told us
how it went, Janie.</line>
   <line>How what went?</line>
   <line>The m*rder.</line>
   <line>Bout the g*n, the barbells.</line>
   <line>I don't know what you mean.</line>
   <line>How you were gonna sink her
in the river after.</line>
   <line>I don't...</line>
   <line>believe you.</line>
   <line>Bout Halley's Comet.</line>
   <line>He told you about that?</line>
   <line>And he wants to know
if you wanna do this together.</line>
   <line>What we thought would save us...</line>
   <line>actually ruined us.</line>
   <line>After she died, we could
never get back the purity.</line>
   <line>So we separated,</line>
   <line>never talked again.</line>
   <line>And the worst thing?</line>
   <line>We never loved anyone else again,</line>
   <line>not the way we loved each other.</line>
   <line>That's the worst thing, huh?</line>
   <line>We belong together.</line>
   <line>We'll go down together.</line>
   <line>Paige?</line>
   <line>It's Bennett.</line>
   <line>I didn't think you'd call.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
Uh...</line>
   <line>I've been, uh...</line>
   <line>Well, Jane and I broke up.</line>
   <line>I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>Yeah. And I was wondering
if you wanted to get together.</line>
   <line>Tonight. I know it's late, but...</line>
   <line>I can sneak out.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I'll pick you up in ten minutes?</line>
   <line>Are you sure you're ready for this?</line>
   <line>I'm sure.</line>
   <line>You know, we don't have to...</line>
   <line>I want to.</line>
   <line>We love each other, and...</line>
   <line>if we're gonna take it to the next level...</line>
   <line>then...</line>
   <line>Hi.</line>
   <line>Hey.
- Nice car.</line>
   <line>Where are we going?</line>
   <line>A nice, quiet place.</line>
   <line>Well, I guess it's time.</line>
   <line>Do it!</line>
   <line>Oh, no!</line>
   <line>No!</line>
   <line>Do it!
You have to do it!</line>
   <line>Do it!
You have to do it!</line>
   <line>Please! Don't...!</line>
   <line>Please... don't...</line>
   <line>I can't believe it.</line>
