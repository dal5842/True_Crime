   <line type="dialogue">Get her in the back.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What... what do I...?
- Follow directions.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, let me get out first.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The guys were digging up the
foundation of the old Calvin building.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They made the discovery this morning.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Two bags of bones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In the cement?
- No, underneath.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So they got thrown in here when they
were first putting up the building?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, the doer figured
they were buried forever,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and now the city wants a parking lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The remains are mostly skeletal,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but they were buried in plastic, so,
uh, a lot of the clothes survived.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One male... one female.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How can you tell that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pelvic bones. Shoe size.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When did bell bottoms
come back in style,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">five years ago?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't look at me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They've been down here
more than five years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This building's at least years old.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So they're from the original
days of bell bottoms.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The ' 's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those pants were ugly
the first time around.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look at that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Summer of love.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where did it all go wrong?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">. You weren't even
born yet, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">World had to wait till the ' s for me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know how many words
there are for narcissist?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Scotty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey. You okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. You just forgot to fill
this out before you left.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll see you upstairs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hi... uh, I'm Elisa.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lilly. / Hi.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My partner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're a detective?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're so beautiful.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">See you up there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did I embarrass you? / No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You never told me
your partner was a girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We... okay today?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's a good day, I think.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Quiet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No box on these two jobs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had to go to Missing Persons.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A white woman and black man
disappeared together June , .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Missing persons didn't
knock themselves out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If you're over and of sound mind,
you're allowed to disappeared.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And the lifesyle.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A lot of people disappeared
in the ' s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Some of 'em don't even know it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The woman was Julia Hoffman, ,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">reported missing by her
parents, now deceased.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lived in a commune.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Disappeared with Gerard Gary, .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks like Julia's station
wagon disappeared, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We ran an NCIC search,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">see if the car ever turned
up anywhere, but no luck.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These bodies were dumped professional
style in that construction site.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which says organized crime.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So how does that intersect
with hippies?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">dr*gs?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had to buy them somewhere.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe the black-white
thing bothered somebody.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got any family contacts
on either of them?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, but we have a name
on a boyfriend for Julia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Another commune member.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You mean the guy she was
found with wasn't her boyfriend?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If he was, she had one at home, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not a bad motive for
boyfriend Number One,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">there being a Number two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's go see this commune guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Adam Clarke, where are you now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Life coach.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You get to choose...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">how to view your experience.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's the empowering choice?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Taking responsibility.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Winners take responsibility, all right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right. See everyone tomorrow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Adam Clarke?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detective Rush and Valens, Homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a room-emptier.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're here about Julia Hoffman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were dating her in ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Till she disappeared on me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her remains have been found.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Along with the remains of Gerard Gary.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You mind?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're herbal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought Julia went to Canada
with that Gerard guy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks like they never
made it out of the city.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ugly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind of relationship
did you two have?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Six months of hot and
heavy in the commune.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Serious?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. I was more serious
about ending the w*r.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So her being with this other
guy didn't rile you at all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We had an open relationship.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was the ' s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was part of the revolution--</line>
   <line type="dialogue">change the world,
change ourselves.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But human nature doesn't always
conform to revolutionary ideals.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that's why I do this work.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And that's being a life coach,
I take it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's easy to make fun of.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We have a saying:</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Being cynical's the booby prize."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any idea if Julia and Gerard
were dealing dr*gs?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No chance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Aw, come on, Adam -- summer of ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, we took dr*gs,
for sure, but... dealing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We just weren't that organized.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The last time you saw Julia, did
you fight, and part on bad terms?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Furthest thing from it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Our soldiers are coming
home in body bags!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Vietnamese people die and die!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, there comes a time when you
have to throw yourself into history,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not stand on the sidelines.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My draft card!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You let'em arrest me!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm saying no!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm saying hell, no!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I... won't... go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, no, we won't go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, no, we won't go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, no, we won't go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, no, we won't go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, no, we won't go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, no, we won't go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, no, we won't go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Glory days, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Intense...
as we used to say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Julia and Gerard being together,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that didn't bring up any intense
feelings, like jealousy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It hurt, some.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But that was our deal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who was the girl with Julia?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her friend Terri.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She lived with us for awhile.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remember her last name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maxwell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A rich Cherry Hill girl who came and
played hippie for a couple of years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now she's a rich art dealer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julia and I were on dishes
duty at the commune.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The men were totally into equality
until we ran out of clean plates.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you knew Adam Clarke?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Of course! He was the
king of the commune.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, he claims he didn't mind
Julia being with Gerard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You believe that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I do, actually.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Only because he was
so... self-absorbed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How so?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was the star of the
anti-w*r movement.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And he was inspiring, I admit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he was an a*s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He thought of himself as
a babe magnet, ' s-style.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, even babe magnets
don't like being dumped.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Especially babe magnets.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I just don't think he cared
enough about Julia to harm her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There is something I didn't
tell the police in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In my world, back then...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you just didn't tell the
cops a lot of things.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oink, oink?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What didn't you tell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julia and Gerard were into
something... clandestine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There were a lot of
secret phone calls...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">who called himself Dr.L.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Julia always had
these envelopes of cash.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And how do you know
Gerard was involved?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The night before they disappeared,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">they were planning something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, no, we won't go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, no, we won't go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The meeting place
doesn't work anymore.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">a.m. tomorrow,
we pick up on a new corner.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She'll have the bread?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yep.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You scared?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No way, baby. You?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hell, no, we won't go!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Does he know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd never tell him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julia was your best friend, and
you didn't ask her what was up?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She didn't wanna tell me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And to be honest,
I was scared to know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was a suburbs girl trying
out the commune life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If it ever got too gritty,
I knew I could always go home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Julia, she was for real,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and she was into something... deep.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forensics found a long
brown hair with the bodies</line>
   <line type="dialogue">under a piece of tape
on the plastic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could be Julia's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll catch a break if it's not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any leads on the missing car?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm. Sludge.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, it was smeared on
the plastic and the clothes,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and has caffeic acid
and pyrazine in it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Chemicals made in
manufacturing coffee.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">k*ller gave'em one last cappuccino?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or they were wrapped
up near the waterfront</line>
   <line type="dialogue">by the Bogata Coffee plant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was it there in ' ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Established ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Smart, Nicky.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gives a specific place to
dredge for a station wagon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That enough to get the divers out?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll call the Marine Unit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was at Woodstock, you know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jimi Hendrix. That cat could play.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did he say "cat"?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You take your clothes off
and roll in the mud, boss?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, set-up and security
for one of the vendors.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which one?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Porta Potti.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now I'm seeing it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's take a look.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's a real time capsule for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">years as a fish motel.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What've you got there, Lil,
a dead fish?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Or a wallet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I should be doing this in the lab.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I won't tell on you, Louie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Want an Orange Crush?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, Elisa you actually
introduce people to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sets her apart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry about that, uh, comment.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't mind getting
called beautiful.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, she's not a hundred
percent healthy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doctor calls it a...
a thinking disorder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sometimes she...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think he's ready.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This pouch was inside the wallet.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And it seems to be airtight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like a ziplock?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So it protected whatever's inside.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What is it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's an address.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">" Spruce Street. Jane."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">West Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do not give out address
except in emergency."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd call a double m*rder an emergency.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives Rush and Valens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're looking for Jane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're here about Jane?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Is she here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, Jane's not a person.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jane's an organization.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm Dr.Linden.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dr.L.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Please come in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were volunteers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then they stopped, suddenly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What were they volunteers for?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">An ab*rtion service.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Underground.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In the ' s, ab*rtion was illegal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Women still had them, of course.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. Coat hangers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Knitting needles.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ballpoint pens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Jane's purpose was to
keep people away from</line>
   <line type="dialogue">those dangerous procedures,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and provide them with safe ones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you were a provider?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Until ' , when the law changed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's with the name, "Jane"?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Security.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everything had to be anonymous.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd that work?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, women would call
a number and ask for Jane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The volunteers would call back,
set up an appointment.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That what Julia and Gerard did?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They escorted the patients,
handled the money,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">they did everything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When did you last see them?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In the morning, the day
they disappeared.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They brought over a young girl...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sorry about the blindfold.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't tell anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Especially if you don't
know where we are.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's not dangerous.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's gonna be okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do I have to do?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The doctor will talk you through it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's a real doctor?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'll get a D and C.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what that is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dilation and curettage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's the safest way.
Dr.L's real good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He helped me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Doctor, this is Renee.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do you do?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come with me now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll get through this together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The procedure went fine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julia and Gerard left with her...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and that's all I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You never got the girl's last name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had to protect my medical license.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Jane must've had her infomation,
in case something went wrong.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Probably.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I only knew the contact people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you get a new contact
after Julia and Gerard?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Colette Ferguson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's a poly sci professor at Temple.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had an emergency number
and first name for that girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Renee.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No last name?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When Julia and Gerard went missing,
I called her, like it was routine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She said everything was fine.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You save that number?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know why.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Last link to Julia, probably.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd have to find it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were close to Julia?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We met under the worst of circumstances.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He says I am.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Does he do it here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The kitchen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's he use?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A bicycle spoke.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He says to keep it in
twenty... four hours...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">then it happens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's supposed to be good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got the $ ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I-I have $ .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, it's four.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I couldn't get more.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll get you some wine.
Calm you down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He made me touch him before.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">W-We should leave.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She took me home, checked
in on me the next day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which was lucky for me,
because I had an infection.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">By the time she got me to the hospital...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bad, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Couldn't have children because of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So... how did Julia get to Dr.Linden?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She found an ad for Jane
in the Free Weekly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was so grateful after,
she went to work for Jane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I did, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And she brought Gerard in?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, he was already a volunteer.
That's how they met.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why was he doing it? He know
someone who had one?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Most everyone does, son.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds risky.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Especially for Gerard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why's that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was in the Black Liberation Front.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were very militant,
and dead set against ab*rtion.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Considered it genocide for Black people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dead set as in m*rder?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">His working for Jane was like a
declaration of w*r to some people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Know anyone we can
talk to from the BLF?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lionel Royce was the
leader the local chapter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where's Lionel now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hear he's in and out of prison.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where he belongs, if he's
the one hurt those two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We want to talk to you about
your old friend Gerard Gary.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tragic man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Limitless potential, unwise choices.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't like some of his activities.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Helping black girls commit genocide?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. I didn't like it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But I'm a peaceful man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what's the r*fle about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remember George W. Bush in that
flight suit, landing on the aircraft carrier?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All about the image.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This... armed robbery beef
you're in for, that just image?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was collecting reparations for sl*very.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From a -eleven?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I had issues with Gerard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">However, if you're
suggesting I'd k*ll a brother?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were way too busy getting
spied on, lied to, informed on,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and framed-up by the U.S.
Government to turn on each other.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think you had an
informant in the BLF.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know there were informants.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And maybe Gerard was one?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's possible.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Way I see it, the White
man's got your mind,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and the White woman's
got your Jonhson.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's a friend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, our friends don't come in that color.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What, you tellin' me who I can see?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta be role models, brother Gerard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can't be running around with no
blue eye, blond hair Barbie doll.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Man, you gonna turn white yourself.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In case you haven't noticed,
the black don't rub off.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But this is serious, brother.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know our secrets, man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You pillow talk with that girl?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You can't trust no white girl.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This ain't real to them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They just playing a game.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This will never be real to them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got to have to dry clean
this place of yours, Gerard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think I'd betray you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Standard operating procedure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So the Black Liberation Front thought
Gerard was talking to the FBI.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even if he was, we'd never
use a b*llet on a black man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd you know it was a b*llet?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just a metaphor, brother man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks for meeting me here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My kids are home... you know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sure.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These people were good to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I feel like they saved my life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't come from money,
and I wasn't smart.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wasn't gonna go to college or
anything, but I wanted to get out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Have a life that was bigger
than two square miles.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I had a baby in high school...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who knew about you being pregnant?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No one, for weeks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And then I told my boyfriend.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He feel the same as you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So we'll get married.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie, I was thinking an ab*rtion.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's illegal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do you even...?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm trying to find out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Renee...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I applied Pan Am.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stewardess training.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I did real good on the test.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tell them something's come up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie, I want to go places...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">London and stuff, you know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can go places together.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, we can't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If we have a baby... we'll
never even leave Fishtown.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You talk like your mind's made up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I need money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Screw you, Renee.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you were on your own.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I asked around and finally
found a girl at school</line>
   <line type="dialogue">whose cousin had a number for "Jane".</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd you pay for it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sold a coat and my record player.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Charlie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought it was best if we
didn't have any contact.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But...?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Renee...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you said those people saved your life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought I saw his truck.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That day?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Right before they picked me up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had no idea anything
happened to those people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wasn't upset about it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's not what Renee said.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She said you wanted to get married.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's what you were supposed
to say if you got a girl in trouble.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So you didn't want to marry her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Excuse me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you were for the ab*rtion?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't want to get involved.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then why were you at the meeting place
the day Renee went for the procedure?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She saw your truck, Charlie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look this is years later.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My wife... / No one's
talking to your wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I followed Renee.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Saw her meet those hippies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And...?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I tailed the car to West Philly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where's Renee?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Be cool, man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Shut that door.
- She in here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, no, this is a private home.
You can't just crash in here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna call the cops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, no you don't wanna do that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But look at you, you're just a kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How old are you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Seventeen.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You want a baby at ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And a wife before your senior prom?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, how about some air, brother?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I cried on that hippie's
shoulder for ten minutes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where were you two
hours later that day?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">With anyone?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, my mom.
She's gone now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's too bad, Charlie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause those hippies
went missing that day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Look, I didn't want Renee to do it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But in retrospect, it was
the right thing for me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you realize that
before or after they died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lil, Scotty, we got
the FBI file on Jane.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What, they had a file?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And they gave it up?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's public record now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We get names of informants?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, they drew the line there,
but we did get these.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, surveillance photos
of the Jane volunteers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julia and Gerard, picking up
and dropping off women</line>
   <line type="dialogue">April through June of ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This your young Renee?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then this was the day they disappeared.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone else was there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone who took these photos
and gave them to the Feds.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">An informant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That nut case Lionel was right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lionel thought Gerard was a snitch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gerard didn't take these.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So who did?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Informants?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sound off the wall?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sounds dated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Our case is dated.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There were always rumors like that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks like a parlor game at the commune,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">trying to decide who the snitch was.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Weird.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was a paranoid time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, it seems there was
someone watching Julia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then I guess it wasn't paranoia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So in the parlor game,
who'd you suspect?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It wasn't a suspicion.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Intuition?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Adam and Julia were non-monogamous.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He told us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Had first-hand knowledge of that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Granted, I was sort of
tripping at the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's so fragile.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can I take its picture?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">These are great.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm documenting the movement.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna do a book someday...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">tell the story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I love this one of Julia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Have any of me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll take some right now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about a rich Jersey girl
beds penniless draft dodger.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The camera was pretty
sophisticated for a guy like him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It came into my mind for a
second, but I was so flattered</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the movement I put it out again.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He ever put out that book?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Boss, we got some.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, us, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Adam Clarke, burning his draft card in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He told us about that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Problem is, Adam shouldn't
have had a draft card in ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We checked his military records.
He's already served.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Vietnam, ' to ' .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Really?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When Adam gets home,
it gets more interesting.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He crossed state lines driving
a "peace van" loaded with weed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Arrested for drug sales.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thought he was too
disorganized for that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The case should have
bought him state time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But then the feds took over
jurisdiction.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Poof. Case went away.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He made a deal with them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Became a CI.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stay in the movement,
keep us informed."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now those photos he had
of Julia really make sense.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Black and White, long lens.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Adam Clarke: ' s babe magnet,
star of the anti-w*r movement.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And FBI informant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That'd be big news.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Big, bad news.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And if Julia found out?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There's your motive for m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you mind?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not at all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know why you're here, Lilly.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was an informant fot the FBI in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My old case agent called.
Give me a heads up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Questions were being asked.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They didn't give us name. / I know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And when you told me
about Julia and Gerard,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I... I hoped that my background
was irrelevant, but...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">it may not be.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was surveilling them
the day they disappeared.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">June , :a.m.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah. This guy's name is
Charlie Rinzler.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I-I know who he is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Is-is that all you have of him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, he was so agitated,
I reported it to my case agent.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Feds ran his license,
had me follow him for a week,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but nothing much came of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, you have photos of Charlie from the
week after Julia and Gerard went missing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, but nothing too exciting.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can I see them anyway?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I basically followed him every
day for a week to and from work.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was a day worker, in construction.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can I take these?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They're yours...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">if I can ask a favor.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If we can keep your secret, we will.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You worked construction back
in the s, huh, Charl?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, couple of summers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Remember a job at the Calvin Building,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">summer of ' ?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Putting down the foundation?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause that just happens to be
where Julia and Gerard were dumped.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The same week you worked there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's an amazing coincidence.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mm, too amazing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That-that can't be right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is you at the
construction site, Charlie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who the hell took that?
- Good luck you had.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That foundation was being laid</line>
   <line type="dialogue">just when you needed to
stash two dead hippies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never hurt them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That guy was nice to me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Long as that building was up,
you figured you were home free.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Too bad they want
a parking lot there now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's coincidence.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I guess I need a lawyer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Update for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forensics is back on the
hair found with the bodies.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It ain't Julia's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So, there was someone else
at the scene with long, brown hair.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was Nixon youth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Crew cut.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about Adam Clarke?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Long.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, but a lot of people
had long hair back then.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Adam came clean
about being an informant.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">FBI wasn't gonna confirm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Put himself in harm's way.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Unless he practices what he preaches.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">People who win face the real facts
of whatever situation they're in."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he looked at the odds,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">knew we'd make him as the informant,
with or without confirmation.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So he steps out ahead of us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Make himself look good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And sets up Charlie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Audacious action, with the element of
surprise, will give you the upper hand."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We know Adam followed
Charlie around for a week.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He saw where he worked.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Could've dumped the
bodies there one night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Which points right to Charlie
if anything ever comes to light.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And Adam gets years
to have a life...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">till his luck runs out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got enough to compel a DNA sample?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, this guy ain't gonna give it up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He already did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Those pictures,
they were real helpful, Adam.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm glad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're an excellent photographer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Composition, framing...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Especially framing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd it go down, anyway?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You get sloppy that day,
Julia and Gerard catch you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I... don't follow.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Charlie didn't k*ll them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good try, though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never said he did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Adam Clarke --
real hippie or... poser?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Real.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My passions were very real.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How'd you like having long hair?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All them strands blowing around.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And guess what, Adam?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One of them blew right into the plastic
bags you wrapped your friends in.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Got stuck under the tape.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A long, brown hair that don't
belong to either of them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think I was the only guy with long
hair those two were in contact with?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, the DNA on this will confirm it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Whether you were a real
hippie or not doesn't matter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your long hair got you in the end.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why'd you do it Adam?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Were you against
what "Jane" was doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I thought they were heroic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't want Julia or
Gerard to be harmed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But then they found out about you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Pretty soon the whole movement would
know you were a snitch for the FBI.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Feds had me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I had no options.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about taking responsibility?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ain't that the winner's way?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I was a leader in the revolution.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were living like it meant something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I loved that life.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Couldn't stand to give it up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ever wonder if Julia
and Gerard felt that way?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Think they loved their lives?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, Jules.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gerard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What are you guys doing here?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's going on, Adam?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You taking our pictures?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm always taking pictures.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, what : in the morning,
on a deserted corner?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I-I don't get this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is sad.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's a snitch.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, Adam Clarke?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who better?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is crazy, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's get in the car. / Adam.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just do it, Jules.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The man of peace and
love has a handgun?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, he ain't that man at all.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just get in the car.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Crank the radio, Gerard.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Turn it up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Adam, please, no...</line>
