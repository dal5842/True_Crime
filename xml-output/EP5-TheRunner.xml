   <line>July ,</line>
   <line>Timmy's sick, the baby's sick,
and the wife's gonna give me hell</line>
   <line>'cause I forgot her mint chip ice cream.</line>
   <line>The other night Diane says,</line>
   <line>Joe, baby, I'm hankering
for some pickles with fish sauce."</line>
   <line>Pregnant women.</line>
   <line>car, go to east Ludlow and
Jones for a domestic disturbance.</line>
   <line>See, now if we answer
that mommie-poppie call</line>
   <line>and my mommie's beating
me down tonight.</line>
   <line>Okay, got it.</line>
   <line>Get outta here.
You split, man.</line>
   <line>No, I ain't letting
you go out on your own.</line>
   <line>I told you to get your a*s home
by midnight, didn't I?</line>
   <line>Hey, wait until the kid's born.</line>
   <line>That's when you'll really
kiss your life good-bye.</line>
   <line>Yeah.
- I hear you, man.</line>
   <line>Thanks, Joe.</line>
   <line>They told me you got the old murders.</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>He said, um,</line>
   <line>you the one that's got to listen to this.</line>
   <line>What is it?</line>
   <line>I found it in a garbage dump over by
the raymond jennings projects.</line>
   <line>You got a name?</line>
   <line>Neesey.</line>
   <line>Neesey, huh?</line>
   <line>That your real name?</line>
   <line>Deniece, okay?
Deniece Funderbunk.</line>
   <line>I already told him.</line>
   <line>So, look, I get anything for this?</line>
   <line>Just a sincere thanks for
your civic-mindedness.</line>
   <line>My civic what?</line>
   <line>Thanks, Ms. Funderbunk.</line>
   <line>I gotta jet.</line>
   <line>A garbage dump?</line>
   <line>You don't mind a little dirt, do you, Rush?</line>
   <line>I hang around you, don't I?</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>Standard cassette player and recorder
way old school. Early ' s.</line>
   <line>I transferred the audio
from analog to digital.</line>
   <line>The stuff after the g*nshots,
the man's muttering,</line>
   <line>I'm still working on that.</line>
   <line>But check this out.</line>
   <line>Shan...</line>
   <line>what's that?</line>
   <line>I'm going to eq it by rolling off
some of the top and bottom,</line>
   <line>filter out the background noise.</line>
   <line>Tweak it and clean it, correct the pitch.
Bam!</line>
   <line>Sounds like some sort of public
announcement system. / Yeah.</line>
   <line>And near a railroad station.</line>
   <line>Sh... shanning station.</line>
   <line>The old train tracks in north Philly.</line>
   <line>They closed that station some time
in the...early ' s.</line>
   <line>A lover's lane.</line>
   <line>You know this from experience?</line>
   <line>Not a soul around.</line>
   <line>Just you and the stars.</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>Lonely place to die.</line>
   <line>Small caliber w*apon fired three times
in the vicinity of shanning station.</line>
   <line>Before it closed in ' .
That narrows it down.</line>
   <line>Where the hell is it?</line>
   <line>Did you say shanning station?
- Yeah.</line>
   <line>You're not gonna find that
box job down here.</line>
   <line>This one was one of our own.</line>
   <line>Never left homicide,</line>
   <line>years.</line>
   <line>Three sh*ts to the heart.</line>
   <line>One year on the force.</line>
   <line>Washington? / Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line>He just graduated from the academy.</line>
   <line>Worked in the th district.
Citywide Manhunt For Cop k*ller</line>
   <line>Raised in a North Carolina orphanage,</line>
   <line>a stint in the military before
entering the police academy.</line>
   <line>Washington was responding
to a domestic call.</line>
   <line>He never made it there.</line>
   <line>A few hours later, they found his body
near the shanning tracks.</line>
   <line>Blood spatter matching</line>
   <line>Washington's blood type was found
in a stolen vehicle</line>
   <line>left on a turnpike two days later.</line>
   <line>It was mostly a dead end.</line>
   <line>We lifted a fingerprint off
the car windshield. No hits.</line>
   <line>Maybe we run the print again.</line>
   <line>I'd like to work with you on this one, Lily.</line>
   <line>I knew Joe Washington.</line>
   <line>You knew his partner?</line>
   <line>Of him.
Butch Rinaldi.</line>
   <line>Why wasn't he with Washington that night?</line>
   <line>I let him go out alone.</line>
   <line>Shouldn't have done that.</line>
   <line>Must have pulled over a motorist that
ran a traffic light or something.</line>
   <line>Joe got three b*ll*ts for his trouble.</line>
   <line>I was standing right here</line>
   <line>when I first seen Diane that night
Joe's wife.</line>
   <line>Butchy!</line>
   <line>No!</line>
   <line>No!</line>
   <line>No!</line>
   <line>Diane lost the baby a few weeks later.</line>
   <line>You last saw Washington
at : midnight.</line>
   <line>That's when our shift ended.</line>
   <line>On the tape, there's a train horn
seconds after the g*nshots.</line>
   <line>We checked train schedules
at the museum.</line>
   <line>Only one arrival that night at : A.M.</line>
   <line>So we can place time of death
about an hour after you saw Washington.</line>
   <line>But shanning's only five minutes
from the precinct.</line>
   <line>Maybe he wasn't headed
to the domestic.</line>
   <line>He said he was, clear as day.</line>
   <line>According to the logs, dispatch sent
another call ten minutes after the domestic.</line>
   <line>Drug activity
at the raymond jennings project</line>
   <line>where the tape recorder was found.</line>
   <line>If Washington responded to that call,
the timeline adds up.</line>
   <line>Raymond jennings wasn't
even in our district.</line>
   <line>Why would Joe go there and
not tell no one?</line>
   <line>That's what we got to find out.</line>
   <line>I did live in the raymond jennings project,
young lady.</line>
   <line>And I called the police that night.</line>
   <line>My tax pays your salary.</line>
   <line>a call you made, Ms. Gloria.</line>
   <line>I remember real good, sir.
You want to know why?</line>
   <line>Because those damn police
actually came for once.</line>
   <line>What does that mean?</line>
   <line>Black folks from the project calling
on Friday night,</line>
   <line>police don't come.</line>
   <line>But that night that
black cop showed up.</line>
   <line>And he gets to fighting
with the drug dealer.</line>
   <line>What drug dealer?
- Never saw him before,</line>
   <line>but after I called the police,
I went out to see what happened,</line>
   <line>not expecting a damn thing.</line>
   <line>Get off my court.</line>
   <line>You don't own this.</line>
   <line>Well, I own this. I own you.</line>
   <line>I own everything you is, Joe boy.</line>
   <line>You ain't better than me.</line>
   <line>You just pretend you is.</line>
   <line>The dealer called him Joe?</line>
   <line>Joe this, Joe that.</line>
   <line>That black cop must have come
around the projects regular</line>
   <line>cause he knew enough not
to park at the curb.</line>
   <line>Those drug dealers'll see him
a-coming a mile away.</line>
   <line>What'd the drug dealer look like?</line>
   <line>Skinny.</line>
   <line>Young.</line>
   <line>Black.</line>
   <line>Strutting around like
some sort of crazy rooster.</line>
   <line>My eyes been bad since forever.</line>
   <line>Can't tell you more.</line>
   <line>But I did hear those druggies
calling him "the runner".</line>
   <line>What?
- The runner.</line>
   <line>What kinda name is that?</line>
   <line>Thank you, Ms. Menards.</line>
   <line>Washington called the k*ller
that on the tape, the runner.</line>
   <line>Cause he knew him.</line>
   <line>They both knew each other.</line>
   <line>Real well.</line>
   <line>I did patrol of the raymond
jennings projects in the ' s.</line>
   <line>Never heard the name the runner.</line>
   <line>Guy ain't in the system anywhere.
No arrests, nothing.</line>
   <line>So how'd this runner and
Washington get so cozy?</line>
   <line>And how'd Washington know those projects
enough to know where to park</line>
   <line>when he didn't even work that district?</line>
   <line>Maybe he had it in for drug dealers.</line>
   <line>Washingtong's patrol log.</line>
   <line>Radioed in calls on dealers
in his district constantly.</line>
   <line>Got into two altercations.</line>
   <line>There's a lot of hate here.</line>
   <line>Love hate.</line>
   <line>No arrests on his record.</line>
   <line>Smoke and mirrors?</line>
   <line>Acts tough for appearances' sake,
but he's really on the take?</line>
   <line>Bank records don't show cash coming in.</line>
   <line>But cash was going out,
every few weeks.</line>
   <line>These didn't cover
his usual living expenses.</line>
   <line>He wrote clearly marked
checks for those.</line>
   <line>And these sums are
big enough to stand out.</line>
   <line>What are we thinking, buying dr*gs?</line>
   <line>No, addicts clean out bank
within a couple months.</line>
   <line>This doesn't follow that pattern.</line>
   <line>So what was he doing?</line>
   <line>Maybe his widow knows.</line>
   <line>The runner?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>I never heard of him.</line>
   <line>How long were you married, Diane?</line>
   <line>Ten months, two weeks.</line>
   <line>Was Joe a big spender? Um...</line>
   <line>first year of marriage and all.</line>
   <line>No. We just got the house.</line>
   <line>Why?</line>
   <line>Um,</line>
   <line>these checks he wrote
for cash every few weeks.</line>
   <line>Do you know what they were for?</line>
   <line>He got me flowers every Friday.</line>
   <line>And movies.</line>
   <line>We went to movies all the time.</line>
   <line>But I never thought
it would amount to that much.</line>
   <line>I thought things would be
different by now.</line>
   <line>That I'd be different.</line>
   <line>Time makes things worse, not better.</line>
   <line>Maybe time also finds the truth.</line>
   <line>Can you tell me what you
remember from that day, Diane?</line>
   <line>We were thinking about
what to name our baby.</line>
   <line>Our little girl.</line>
   <line>Marianne.
- No.</line>
   <line>Martha.
- Uh-uh.</line>
   <line>Matilda.
- No way.</line>
   <line>Okay, Mr. Man,</line>
   <line>let me see you come up with
something more groovy.</line>
   <line>You want groovy, baby?</line>
   <line>Uh-huh, I want far out,
psychedelic, groovy.</line>
   <line>How about Diane?</line>
   <line>I'm vibing Diane.</line>
   <line>I love diane.</line>
   <line>You do?</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>Love me?</line>
   <line>I do.</line>
   <line>You know what else?
- What?</line>
   <line>I'm gonna love ya, love ya,
love ya just a little more.</line>
   <line>Come here, baby.</line>
   <line>Joe left for work minutes later...</line>
   <line>and I never saw him again.</line>
   <line>I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>Sometimes I think,</line>
   <line>My god, she'd be a woman by now.</line>
   <line>My little girl.</line>
   <line>Anyway...</line>
   <line>Um,</line>
   <line>if you think of anything else.</line>
   <line>Detective Rush?</line>
   <line>Could you tell from the tape</line>
   <line>whether Joe was in pain when he died?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>He wasn't.</line>
   <line>I don't know if Diane was telling
the truth about the money.</line>
   <line>Wonder why she was never asked about it.</line>
   <line>Maybe Butch has an idea.</line>
   <line>Tonight's first Thursday at the tavern right?
Bet he'll be there.</line>
   <line>You're not going to first Thursday.
- Why not?</line>
   <line>The old timers don't take too kindly to
women crashing their night with the boys.</line>
   <line>Too bad. It's a new world.</line>
   <line>Those dinosaurs are
bad enough sober, Lilly.</line>
   <line>You saying you won't go with me?</line>
   <line>I'm saying go see Butch in the morning.</line>
   <line>Forget Jones tavern.</line>
   <line>Wife know you're on a date tonight?</line>
   <line>Hey, Butch.</line>
   <line>You know detective Rush.</line>
   <line>How you doing, Butch?</line>
   <line>This one's for Joe Washington
and all the guys who died on the line.</line>
   <line>We got to talk.</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Diane called and told me about the crap
you came asking about Joe's money.</line>
   <line>There was money going
out of his account.</line>
   <line>You know what it was for?</line>
   <line>This ain't no place to bring a lady, bro.</line>
   <line>Any ideas about the money, Butch?
- No.</line>
   <line>Turns out Washington knew
runner real well.</line>
   <line>I hope no one's trying to associate
my fallen partner with some drug dealer.</line>
   <line>How'd he know runner, Butch?
- She thinks she can come in here...</line>
   <line>Just answer the question.
- Smearing a good cop's name...</line>
   <line>Hey!</line>
   <line>I'm the one asking the questions.</line>
   <line>So what's your question, detective?</line>
   <line>Was Washington paying someone off?</line>
   <line>You know who we got here, boys?</line>
   <line>The only female in homicide
working cold cases.</line>
   <line>Know why?
- Maybe you ought to sit down, Butch.</line>
   <line>Cause it's in the basement.</line>
   <line>Where the little lady can
dust down the files.</line>
   <line>So how'd it go at the tavern?</line>
   <line>a*s handed to me.</line>
   <line>Does that surprise you?</line>
   <line>I think Sarreti, the assigned on the case,
suspected the drug angle, too.</line>
   <line>An interview Sarreti did
with Deante Rollins, heroin dealer.</line>
   <line>His territory was raymond jennings
in the early ' 's.</line>
   <line>Like Sarreti was wondering
about the cash himself.</line>
   <line>But we can't ask him 'cause he keeled
over from a heart attack last year.</line>
   <line>And back then,</line>
   <line>Deante wasn't sharing.
- What about now?</line>
   <line>Maybe he's learned to play with others.</line>
   <line>Never heard of no runner.</line>
   <line>You sure about that?</line>
   <line>Like I say, never heard of him.</line>
   <line>And your word is bond, Deante.</line>
   <line>My name is Brother Jamal.</line>
   <line>Sure it is.</line>
   <line>Asalaam a fakim, my brother.</line>
   <line>Like you know what that means.</line>
   <line>What does it mean, Jamal?</line>
   <line>Peace be with you.</line>
   <line>Have you found it yet?</line>
   <line>Peace?</line>
   <line>It's a journey.</line>
   <line>There is no it.</line>
   <line>There is no end.</line>
   <line>A tough road, redemption.</line>
   <line>Yes, especially when you're dealing
smack to women and children.</line>
   <line>I never sold to children. Ever.</line>
   <line>Back in the day, we was businessmen.</line>
   <line>Organized, chains of command,</line>
   <line>none of this teenage gangsta bull today.</line>
   <line>You were disciplined.
- That's right.</line>
   <line>Working those basketball courts,
-seven, .</line>
   <line>Never missed a day.</line>
   <line>So you were there that night
Washington got k*lled.</line>
   <line>And you must have seen the fight.</line>
   <line>Yeah. I seen it.</line>
   <line>You don't own this, man.</line>
   <line>Well, I own this. I own you.</line>
   <line>I own everything you is, Joe boy.</line>
   <line>And the cop runs up into the projects.</line>
   <line>What was he doing?</line>
   <line>A few minutes later
he comes running back down.</line>
   <line>Sam!</line>
   <line>Sammy!</line>
   <line>Sammy!</line>
   <line>Sam!</line>
   <line>Sammy!</line>
   <line>Where'd Sammy go to?</line>
   <line>What about runner?
You seen him?</line>
   <line>Where did runner go, huh?!</line>
   <line>Took off in some car, man!</line>
   <line>Towards the tracks, man!</line>
   <line>Who's Sammy?</line>
   <line>The reason runner and his homie split
'cause of something that happened to her.</line>
   <line>Who was his homie?</line>
   <line>All I know is they was tight.</line>
   <line>Had the same tattoo on their knuckles.</line>
   <line>Here we go.
Joseph Washingtongs autopsy photo.</line>
   <line>From the original negative,</line>
   <line>I printed onto technical pan film
and transferred onto high contrast slides.</line>
   <line>From what you asked, I figured
density slicing might do the trick.</line>
   <line>What's that?</line>
   <line>It's when you take each scale of gray
and you print it as pure black and white.</line>
   <line>Is that the best you can do, Ray?</line>
   <line>Matter of fact, I did better.</line>
   <line>And better.</line>
   <line>Better.</line>
   <line>So that's how Washington
knew the runner.</line>
   <line>Washington hung with a small-time</line>
   <line>heroin dealer called the runner
in the early ' s.</line>
   <line>We checked juvie records
in the court history database.</line>
   <line>Used the tattoo as an identifying mark.</line>
   <line>Meet the real Joe Washington.</line>
   <line>years old, arrested for selling smack.</line>
   <line>Gave the arresting officer a false name.</line>
   <line>That's why police background
check missed it.</line>
   <line>No North Carolina orphanage?</line>
   <line>Fairy tale.</line>
   <line>He grew up in raymond jennings.</line>
   <line>Straightens out, starts flying right,
joins the military.</line>
   <line>Then the police academy.</line>
   <line>Gets married, and...</line>
   <line>we know the rest.</line>
   <line>So Washington buried who
he was from everyone.</line>
   <line>Even his wife?</line>
   <line>I never knew those things about him.</line>
   <line>He never told you where
he really came from?</line>
   <line>There were other things he was
hiding from you, weren't there?</line>
   <line>Someone robbed you, Diane...</line>
   <line>of your husband, of your child.</line>
   <line>don't you think he should pay?</line>
   <line>Everybody wanted to remember him
as this golden boy...</line>
   <line>great cop...</line>
   <line>great husband.</line>
   <line>I didn't want to rain on their parade.</line>
   <line>By doing what?</line>
   <line>I knew he was...</line>
   <line>he was involved with somebody else.</line>
   <line>Married less than a year
and already cheating.</line>
   <line>What a joke.</line>
   <line>One afternoon,
he went out to the sh**ting range,</line>
   <line>and I needed something from the store,
so I called him.</line>
   <line>He wasn't there.
He never showed up.</line>
   <line>When he came home that night,</line>
   <line>I said,
"hey baby, how was target practice?"</line>
   <line>And he said, fine.</line>
   <line>It was fine.</line>
   <line>I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>He'd go out two,
maybe three times a month.</line>
   <line>One day I followed him...</line>
   <line>Sammy.</line>
   <line>It's me.</line>
   <line>Her name was Sammy?</line>
   <line>Yes. / And she lived at
the raymond jennings projects?</line>
   <line>Did you ever confront Joe about her?</line>
   <line>I was years old and pregnant.
What was the point?</line>
   <line>And you never told the
assigned detective this?</line>
   <line>Or even butch?</line>
   <line>Like I said, what was the point?</line>
   <line>I always wanted to
go back there one day...</line>
   <line>meet her face to face,</line>
   <line>but I never did.</line>
   <line>Heads up. You never know when
a  TV might fall out of a window.</line>
   <line>Samuela?</line>
   <line>This must be the girl who drove
Washington and runner apart.</line>
   <line>Looks like our sammy.</line>
   <line>Think she's still here?</line>
   <line>After all these years?</line>
   <line>In these projects,
where you're born is where you die.</line>
   <line>We're looking for Samuela Robbins?</line>
   <line>Yes, I am she.</line>
   <line>You're miss Samuela?</line>
   <line>Yes. I said that already.</line>
   <line>Detectives Rush and Jeffries.</line>
   <line>Could we come in?
- I'd rather you not, thank you.</line>
   <line>Did you know a Joe Washington,
Miss Samuela?</line>
   <line>You here about Joe?</line>
   <line>You should have said so! Come in.</line>
   <line>Joe grew up on this very floor.</line>
   <line>Why, he took care of Sammy
ever since they were kids.</line>
   <line>Sammy?</line>
   <line>My granddaughter, Samantha.</line>
   <line>They grew up together?</line>
   <line>Like brother and sister.</line>
   <line>He'd bring her back from
school every day.</line>
   <line>Real protective.</line>
   <line>She was all the love
he had in the world.</line>
   <line>Do you remember
when you last saw him?</line>
   <line>Well, after he moved out,
he used to come by all the time,</line>
   <line>bring her toys, take her to the fair.</line>
   <line>Why, on that night he...</line>
   <line>the night he what? / Oh...</line>
   <line>no, I..I don't know.</line>
   <line>The night he was k*lled.
Isn't that what you mean?</line>
   <line>No. I don't know anything.</line>
   <line>I don't.</line>
   <line>Joe loved your granddaughter,
like his own blood, didn't he?</line>
   <line>Yes, he did.</line>
   <line>And he came here the night
he was k*lled, didn't he?</line>
   <line>Yes, he did.</line>
   <line>Joe?</line>
   <line>He think he owns me.</line>
   <line>Owns Sammy!</line>
   <line>What's wrong?</line>
   <line>I thought Sammy was in her room.</line>
   <line>Oh, she's messing with runner,
takes him them dr*gs.</line>
   <line>You know that, Mrs. Samuela?</line>
   <line>I... she won't listen to me,
and I can't keep her in the house all day.</line>
   <line>I'm sorry, Miss Samuela.</line>
   <line>I know it ain't your fault.</line>
   <line>It's just the way things go around here.</line>
   <line>Now it's my turn to take care of Sammy.</line>
   <line>You know we talked about this.</line>
   <line>You know she gots to get out of here</line>
   <line>if she's ever going to
have a chance for a life.</line>
   <line>That night Joe was k*lled,</line>
   <line>and Sammy...
it was difficult, you understand?</line>
   <line>No mother, no father,
just me and Joe.</line>
   <line>And then he was gone.</line>
   <line>So why didn't you come forward
when Joe was m*rder*d?</line>
   <line>There was nothing
I could do to bring him back.</line>
   <line>And Sammy..</line>
   <line>where is she?</line>
   <line>I haven't seen her in over years.</line>
   <line>The dr*gs, they kind of took her over
when Joe died.</line>
   <line>Did you know someone...</line>
   <line>called the runner?</line>
   <line>Joe's best friend.</line>
   <line>Mason Tucker.</line>
   <line>They went to the catholic
school together, ran track.</line>
   <line>So that's why the nickname.</line>
   <line>Long way from raymond jennings,
aren't you, Mason?</line>
   <line>Can I help you?</line>
   <line>Detectives Rush and Jeffries.
Homicide.</line>
   <line>We just had a few questions.</line>
   <line>About Joe Washington?</line>
   <line>Your homie from high school?</line>
   <line>Your little drug-running buddy?</line>
   <line>I knew Joe.</line>
   <line>What's your point?</line>
   <line>Night he was m*rder*d, we got witnesses
in the projects saying you two had a fight.</line>
   <line>I don't remember no fight.</line>
   <line>Course not.</line>
   <line>Remember what you were fighting about?</line>
   <line>I'll say it again, I don't remember.</line>
   <line>How about Sammy?</line>
   <line>Do you remember her?</line>
   <line>Your point being?
- The girl had a lot of problems,</line>
   <line>and from what I hear,
you had something to do with it.</line>
   <line>Whatever problems Sammy had
were Joe's doing, not mine.</line>
   <line>That's not what I hear.</line>
   <line>I hear it was all on you, Mason.</line>
   <line>Then I suggest you check
the hospital records yourself.</line>
   <line>He was the one who brought
her in, not me.</line>
   <line>Now, if you don't have anything else,
I'd like to enjoy my afternoon.</line>
   <line>Oh, uh, one last question.</line>
   <line>How does one go from
selling smack to selling jags?</line>
   <line>Children do dumb things.</line>
   <line>I'm sure you did, too, detective Rush.</line>
   <line>That isn't who I am now.</line>
   <line>Sammy was like
a little sister to Washington.</line>
   <line>He felt responsible for her,</line>
   <line>for Mason Tucker.</line>
   <line>The night of the m*rder, Washington</line>
   <line>hears a radio call about drug activity
at the raymond jennings projects.</line>
   <line>And from the description,
he knows it's mason?</line>
   <line>He goes to the projects,
fights with mason,</line>
   <line>gets Sammy's grandma to okay
his plan to get her out of there,</line>
   <line>Sammy's gone.</line>
   <line>Washington hears Mason took off
for the railroad tracks.</line>
   <line>He follows.</line>
   <line>And that's where he ends up dead.</line>
   <line>And Mason drops off the face of the earth.</line>
   <line>Only to reemerge as a law-abiding,</line>
   <line>yacht-owning citizen years later.</line>
   <line>Deante talked about an incident
that went down</line>
   <line>between mason, Sammy and
Washington years before the m*rder.</line>
   <line>Do we know what it was?</line>
   <line>Only that it put her in the hospital.</line>
   <line>Mm-mm.</line>
   <line>Please don't let it be that.</line>
   <line>We got to look at it.</line>
   <line>The nearest emergency room
is Saint Joseph's.</line>
   <line>Well, the best person to
ask is Sammy herself.</line>
   <line>Check narcotic intelligence.</line>
   <line>Just got the news.</line>
   <line>We got a hit on the fingerprint inside
the stolen car.</line>
   <line>The k*ller's car?</line>
   <line>The print in the car matches
Samantha Robbins.</line>
   <line>Sammy was in the car
when Washington got k*lled.</line>
   <line>Thanks for the tip about the hospital.</line>
   <line>So Sammy od'd on heroin in .</line>
   <line>Now how's a little girl
get her hands on that?</line>
   <line>I wouldn't know.</line>
   <line>No?</line>
   <line>Cause Washington told
the doctors you gave it to her.</line>
   <line>That's a lie.</line>
   <line>You're right.</line>
   <line>You know what, Mason?
I'm like you. I lie a lot.</line>
   <line>Let's both try something new...</line>
   <line>the truth.</line>
   <line>Sure.</line>
   <line>I'll tell you the truth.</line>
   <line>You want know what happened to Sammy?</line>
   <line>It was during high school.</line>
   <line>Me and Washington were
getting high all the time.</line>
   <line>Hey...</line>
   <line>hey, you're my bro, you know that man?</line>
   <line>You all I got, Washington.</line>
   <line>We gonna own this world, you and me.</line>
   <line>Can I play?</line>
   <line>Get outta here.</line>
   <line>Please?</line>
   <line>I wanna play the game.
- I said get outta here!</line>
   <line>Don't yell at the angel, bro.</line>
   <line>Sammy, put that down.</line>
   <line>Shut up, Washington.</line>
   <line>Ow!</line>
   <line>So that's why he went his way
and you went yours?</line>
   <line>Seems to be the way the ball bounced.</line>
   <line>Mason, I know sammy was in the car
that night Joe was k*lled.</line>
   <line>Who told you that?</line>
   <line>A middle-aged heroin whore?</line>
   <line>Joe was running from
his guilt about Sammy.</line>
   <line>What about you?</line>
   <line>What are you running from?</line>
   <line>You wanna talk to me,</line>
   <line>talk to my lawyer...</line>
   <line>b*tch.</line>
   <line>Cop on kensington said
Sammy's in here.</line>
   <line>Coming on the end of her days.</line>
   <line>This her first time in detox?
- Uh-huh.</line>
   <line>Bet it won't be her last.</line>
   <line>Maybe it will be.</line>
   <line>Why?</line>
   <line>Cause maybe
she's looking for forgiveness.</line>
   <line>I thought Denise Funderbunk was
a pretty weird name.</line>
   <line>One of the counselors here,
that's her name.</line>
   <line>For real.</line>
   <line>Thanks for bringing in the tape recorder.</line>
   <line>Your tape recorder.</line>
   <line>Why you here anyway?</line>
   <line>Why ain't you arresting the guy
who did it?</line>
   <line>We need your help, Sammy.</line>
   <line>I'm clean outta help.
Ain't got nothing to give.</line>
   <line>Sorry.</line>
   <line>It's all about you, isn't it?</line>
   <line>Always getting in trouble.</line>
   <line>Always waiting for someone
to bail you out.</line>
   <line>That's why Joe came
to the projects that night.</line>
   <line>That's why he died,
helping you.</line>
   <line>Helping me?
Helping me?</line>
   <line>He lied to me!</line>
   <line>He promised and then
he just went and died!</line>
   <line>What did Joe promise
you the night he died?</line>
   <line>He promised to take me home.</line>
   <line>Hey, get off of my car.</line>
   <line>You don't own this.</line>
   <line>Well, I own this. I own you.</line>
   <line>I own everything you is, Joe boy.</line>
   <line>You ain't better than me.</line>
   <line>You just pretend you is.</line>
   <line>Sammy!</line>
   <line>Sammy.</line>
   <line>Look, I told you not to mess with Mason!</line>
   <line>I told you not to touch that crap!</line>
   <line>I didn't do nothing!
You can't tell me what to do!</line>
   <line>You ain't my daddy!
- You ain't got no daddy.</line>
   <line>You ain't got nobody.
I'm all you got.</line>
   <line>You shut up!
You shut up!</line>
   <line>Look, look,
come here, come here.</line>
   <line>Come here.</line>
   <line>My wife's going to take care of you.</line>
   <line>Give you the love you don't know.</line>
   <line>Let's go up and talk to your grandma.</line>
   <line>She won't let me go.</line>
   <line>I'll go, okay?</line>
   <line>You stay here and wait for me, okay?</line>
   <line>Mason don't own you, Sammy.</line>
   <line>You own you.</line>
   <line>Really?</line>
   <line>You gonna wait for me or what?</line>
   <line>Gimme so skin.</line>
   <line>He went up and never came down.</line>
   <line>That's all I know.</line>
   <line>Hmm. Really?</line>
   <line>Really.</line>
   <line>So how'd your tape recorder
get in mason's car?</line>
   <line>And your fingerprint?</line>
   <line>You think this is over?</line>
   <line>Just 'cause you dropped
a tape recorder on my desk?</line>
   <line>Ever hear of the eighth step, Sammy?</line>
   <line>Making amends.</line>
   <line>It's not over.</line>
   <line>Not till you tell me
what happened on those tracks that night.</line>
   <line>Big old bad Mason don't own you.</line>
   <line>You own you.</line>
   <line>You think you can just walk on out
after all I done for you?</line>
   <line>I gotta pee, runner.</line>
   <line>Well, he thinks he can take
what's mine and walk away?</line>
   <line>I own you.</line>
   <line>He don't own you. I do.</line>
   <line>Come here.
Come here.</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>When I woke up,
we weren't at the tracks any more.</line>
   <line>We was headed back to the projects.</line>
   <line>Mason was driving and talking, and...</line>
   <line>he just kept talking to himself.</line>
   <line>What was he saying?</line>
   <line>The lord's prayer.</line>
   <line>He left me near the garbage dump
outside my building.</line>
   <line>Like a piece of trash.</line>
   <line>You never answered my question...</line>
   <line>about why you're running.</line>
   <line>And why it never ends...</line>
   <line>the running.</line>
   <line>I'm not talking to you.</line>
   <line>I'm talking to you.</line>
   <line>Fact is, I'm here to arrest you.</line>
   <line>So sit down.</line>
   <line>We found Sammy.</line>
   <line>You were wrong.</line>
   <line>You don't own her.</line>
   <line>I know you.</line>
   <line>You don't know a thing about me.</line>
   <line>I know what it's like to run</line>
   <line>from who you are...</line>
   <line>I don't know what you're talking about.</line>
   <line>...From what you did.</line>
   <line>But you can't, can you?</line>
   <line>So you spend your whole life running.</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>Runner!</line>
   <line>Our father,</line>
   <line>who art in heaven...</line>
   <line>what're you doing here?</line>
   <line>you're praying.</line>
   <line>Thy kingdom come,
thy will be done on earth...</line>
   <line>You were asking for forgiveness.</line>
   <line>Remember?</line>
   <line>He should have never
tried to change things.</line>
   <line>He should have never come back.</line>
   <line>He... he should... he... he...</line>
   <line>he was all the love I had in this world.</line>
   <line>Joe was looking for forgiveness.</line>
   <line>I think you are, too.</line>
   <line>It's time, isn't it?
To forgive yourself...</line>
   <line>runner?</line>
