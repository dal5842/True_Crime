   <line>September ,
I understand that,</line>
   <line>but I'm getting paid on...</line>
   <line>I am listening.
You're not listening.</line>
   <line>I'm getting paid...
- Hi, baby.¡¡¡¡¡¡¡¡</line>
   <line>If you'd just give me
a brief moment to...</line>
   <line>I'm not giving attitude.</line>
   <line>Hello?</line>
   <line>Hello?</line>
   <line>Midnight,
they're gonna shut my gas.</line>
   <line>What you bring?
Chicken?</line>
   <line>For the concert.</line>
   <line>I gotta do these bills.
You should go.</line>
   <line>Honey, I can see Nirvana anytime.</line>
   <line>You know, you could ask Krystal
for the money. She'll help you.</line>
   <line>I know. I don't wanna ask.</line>
   <line>I'm gonna heave
that thing out the window.</line>
   <line>Here, Grandma.
Here's your tea.</line>
   <line>Don't touch that.</line>
   <line>This is worse than pro wrestling.</line>
   <line>Shush. You don't know
anything about it.</line>
   <line>These guys'll bleed every last cent.</line>
   <line>Can't take it with you.</line>
   <line>So, it's a freezing February night.</line>
   <line>I'm up, get this call
about midnight.</line>
   <line>Oh, is this the Jamaican job?
That's a good one.</line>
   <line>Yeah. You know how
Jamaican jobs are, right?</line>
   <line>I mean, aliases, no papers.</line>
   <line>Give me a bag of bones any day.
- Yeah, well, I'm in a slump,</line>
   <line>and I need a cake job
like you wouldn't believe.</line>
   <line>So he gets this call
out of, uh, North Central.</line>
   <line>You telling this or me?
- No, go ahead. It's your story.</line>
   <line>So, anyway, we're riding out,
and I'm thinking, I hope
this is not a Jamaican.</line>
   <line>Please don't
let this be a Jamaican.</line>
   <line>Don't-don't finish it.
Vera, Homicide.</line>
   <line>So anyway, I get out there.</line>
   <line>This guy's on the front seat,
frozen through.</line>
   <line>And he's a Jamaican.
- No. He's a Burmese Buddhist Monk.</line>
   <line>I take one look, I say to Vera,
"why couldn't he be Jamaican?"</line>
   <line>Hold on just a second.</line>
   <line>You couldn't wait?</line>
   <line>It's for you.
Another cold one.</line>
   <line>Why do you got to be like that?
Some of those stories of yours I like.</line>
   <line>Uh, Detective Rush.</line>
   <line>I wanna tell you about a m*rder.</line>
   <line>And this happened a while ago?</line>
   <line>In .</line>
   <line>What's your name?</line>
   <line>I don't wanna tell you my name.</line>
   <line>Okay, what do you
want to tell me?</line>
   <line>She was elderly.</line>
   <line>Who was elderly, the victim?</line>
   <line>Her name was Krystal Hogan.</line>
   <line>At her age, there was
no defending herself.</line>
   <line>How old was she?</line>
   <line>Almost .</line>
   <line>How is it you know
she was m*rder*d?</line>
   <line>I did it.</line>
   <line>Guy confess to m*rder,
and he won't tell you his name?</line>
   <line>Maybe it's a hoax.</line>
   <line>I can't find a box on the lady.</line>
   <line>Well, it's not Krystal Hogan,</line>
   <line>but I-I seem to remember
a K. Dugan when I was on the line.</line>
   <line>Maybe on ' job.</line>
   <line>Kendall Dugan.
Drug sh**ting.</line>
   <line>Oh, right.</line>
   <line>So, did you run her name
through the computer?</line>
   <line>Waiting for something to kick out.</line>
   <line>Well, there's not much else
you can do, though.</line>
   <line>Lil?</line>
   <line>That fellow's back on the line.</line>
   <line>You hung up on me.
- I was having second thoughts.</line>
   <line>Now I'm not.</line>
   <line>Well, I don't have a box
on Krystal Hogan. Sorry.</line>
   <line>What does that mean?
- No box, no body, no crime.</line>
   <line>Maybe you're just a guy
who likes to talking to police.</line>
   <line>You don't believe me?</line>
   <line>I'll tell you where the body is.</line>
   <line>Okay.</line>
   <line>Elm Street...</line>
   <line>Germantown.</line>
   <line>In the basement.</line>
   <line>Wanna tell me your name now?</line>
   <line>Guy's real up front,
or messing with me good.</line>
   <line>Gave you an address?
- I'll run it.</line>
   <line>Don't have enough for a warrant.
- So, finesse the neighborhood.</line>
   <line>Right. Worth a door knock.</line>
   <line>Are you Brad Meyer?
- Yeah. Who are you?</line>
   <line>Philadelphia Police.
Detective Rush.</line>
   <line>Oh, low blow.
Someone called the cops on me?</line>
   <line>No. Uh, can I talk to you a minute?</line>
   <line>What's going on?</line>
   <line>This is my wife, Dana.
She's police.</line>
   <line>I'm just looking into something
that might have happened around
here several years back.</line>
   <line>Thought it was about us getting rowdy.
- We only moved in eight months ago.</line>
   <line>Maybe you should try that lady,
Joan, across the street.</line>
   <line>She brought us moving-in casserole</line>
   <line>and knows the neightborhood
business pretty good.</line>
   <line>Thank you.</line>
   <line>Krystal Hogan.
She was an old p*stol.</line>
   <line>So, you knew her?
- Lived right over there.</line>
   <line>When was that?
- , years ago.</line>
   <line>She moved in
with her son's family.</line>
   <line>Then... this was awful...
the son and his wife died
in a crash on the turnpike.</line>
   <line>That left Krystal alone over there
with her grandson.</line>
   <line>Hmm. Do you remember
the grandson's name?</line>
   <line>James. Just a teenager.
Acted like one, too.</line>
   <line>Always riding around in his car.</line>
   <line>James, was that you honking
that horn? / Yeah.</line>
   <line>Honk, honk, honk.
- Sorry.</line>
   <line>Show some courtesy.
- I told you to be waiting outside.</line>
   <line>You don't tell your grandmother
to wait outside. / I have a date.</line>
   <line>And if we don't do this now...
- Oh, hold your horses.</line>
   <line>I forgot my keys.
- I got keys. Let's keep moving.</line>
   <line>James, will you stop rushing me?</line>
   <line>You know what?
I'm screwed now anyway.</line>
   <line>Taking care of his grandma
put a real strain on James.</line>
   <line>Anyway, poor old Krystal
eventually went missing.</line>
   <line>When was this?
- ' , .</line>
   <line>Wandered off.</line>
   <line>The kid went to the police.</line>
   <line>Put flyers all around,
including one on my door.</line>
   <line>Used some kind of tape
that took off the paint.</line>
   <line>A body in our basement?
- It's a possiblity.</line>
   <line>Outrageous.
I told you that was weird.</line>
   <line>What was weird?</line>
   <line>This cat from the moving company.</line>
   <line>What company?</line>
   <line>The other day they were moving
a family in down the block.</line>
   <line>One of the workers stops over,
says he grew up in this house.</line>
   <line>And he wants to have a look around?</line>
   <line>You'd think he'd want to see
his old bedroom or something,</line>
   <line>but this dude... he only wants
to see the basement.</line>
   <line>I basically live down here.</line>
   <line>Got my bar, my video games, stereo,</line>
   <line>various whatnots.</line>
   <line>That's odd.</line>
   <line>What are these bricks about?
- That's the old coal chute.</line>
   <line>You do this?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>Coroner says from the pelvis,
it's a female.</line>
   <line>And she has her teeth,
so we'll get an ID.</line>
   <line>What about her age?
- Sutures on the skull are closed up.</line>
   <line>She was elderly.</line>
   <line>So your guy was for real.</line>
   <line>I just hope he calls back.</line>
   <line>That the file from missing persons?</line>
   <line>Krystal Hogan. October ' .</line>
   <line>Yeah, the grandson,
James filed the report.</line>
   <line>Did the investigators
do the job right?</line>
   <line>They put out an APB,</line>
   <line>checked the morgues, hospitals,
jail system.</line>
   <line>Took statement, from this James,
some others... don't tell you much.</line>
   <line>Says there were no other relatives.</line>
   <line>They got dementia written down, question
mark, case was filed pending more info.</line>
   <line>Mm-hmm, but then, in ' ,</line>
   <line>James petitioned the court
to declare grandma dead.</line>
   <line>They allowed him to collect
on a $ , life insurance policy.</line>
   <line>Well, it won't buy you the ers,
but it does give you motive.</line>
   <line>Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line>What about the moving company?
Does James work for one?</line>
   <line>Haven't made that connect yet.
- But we're thinking he's the caller?</line>
   <line>Rush.</line>
   <line>Line two. It's him.</line>
   <line>Anyway we trace this, boss?</line>
   <line>We wish.</line>
   <line>Detective Rush.</line>
   <line>I don't like that you said that.</line>
   <line>Said what?
- That I just like talking to police.</line>
   <line>I wouldn't be doing this
if I didn't have to.</line>
   <line>So, why are you doing this?</line>
   <line>Listen, James, I'm just
trying to do my job here.</line>
   <line>Still there?</line>
   <line>I'm here.</line>
   <line>Are you surprisedI know your name?</line>
   <line>I guess not.</line>
   <line>Look, did you find the body?</line>
   <line>James, the best thing for you
is to come into Police Headquarters.</line>
   <line>Just tell me, yes or no.</line>
   <line>DMV photo.</line>
   <line>I know you found her.</line>
   <line>I mean, you had to.</line>
   <line>Hello?</line>
   <line>Uh, uh, I'm here.
Um, uh, I was thinking.</line>
   <line>Thinking what?</line>
   <line>I understand what you're doing.
I do that.</line>
   <line>I'll, uh, I'll be in a dark mood</line>
   <line>and I'll turn to people
who I don't really know.</line>
   <line>Seems safer.</line>
   <line>I don't wanna talk.</line>
   <line>Well, hey, it doesn't have to be me.</line>
   <line>Are you religious?
I-I can get you anybody you want.</line>
   <line>James?</line>
   <line>I'm here.</line>
   <line>Why'd you k*ll her?
She wasn't a good grandma?</line>
   <line>No, she was.</line>
   <line>You wanna tell me how you did it?</line>
   <line>You're making my head hurt.</line>
   <line>James, how about we hang up?</line>
   <line>You wanna hang up?</line>
   <line>Yeah, I'll give you
my cell phone number.</line>
   <line>That was you can take a bunch of
breaths, collect your thoughts,
and then we'll figure this out.</line>
   <line>James?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Risky play.</line>
   <line>I was losing him.</line>
   <line>Give him my number,
maybe build a trust.</line>
   <line>What's out take on this guy?</line>
   <line>We know he was orphaned.</line>
   <line>Lost both parents on the same night.</line>
   <line>And at , he was solely responsible
for an -year-old woman.</line>
   <line>No other family?</line>
   <line>All alone in the world.</line>
   <line>Auto-track just spit out
his current address. We got him.</line>
   <line>Philadelphia Police.</line>
   <line>Police! Anyone here?</line>
   <line>Clear.</line>
   <line>Guy didn't finish his chicken potpie.</line>
   <line>Must've been in a hurry.
- He knew we were on to him.</line>
   <line>You find something?</line>
   <line>Something.</line>
   <line>Listen, darling.
I don't mean to make you tense.</line>
   <line>I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>I just want us to
move up in the world.</line>
   <line>Love you, Sherry."</line>
   <line>Sherry, who?</line>
   <line>Fox.</line>
   <line who="Postmark"> February, .</line>
   <line>You still reading your
love letters from years ago?</line>
   <line>This guy's reliving a better time,</line>
   <line>'cause Brotherly Luv Movers is
paying a sl*ve wage.</line>
   <line>Guy's living alone, got a bad job,
getting older.</line>
   <line>Self-seteem's shot,
so he's breaking out the old love letters.</line>
   <line>Guilt over grandma's gaining on him.</line>
   <line>But still, why does
he crack after years?
Why not or .</line>
   <line>Hmm. I'm gonna call Jeffries,
get him on the hunt for this foxy lady.</line>
   <line>In the meantime, let's see
if Brotherly Luv has any for James.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I got a job over
in Germantown</line>
   <line>three days ago.</line>
   <line>James Hogan was on that crew?
- Yeah.</line>
   <line>Listen, that guy's a hell of a worker.</line>
   <line>Shows up on time,
doesn't clown around, dependable.</line>
   <line>So he's full-time?
- Yeah, and then some.</line>
   <line>Been with us close to three years now.</line>
   <line>Why isn't he here today?</line>
   <line>This ain't union,</line>
   <line>I give him the days he wants.</line>
   <line>It was the first time James asked.
So I told him to take the week.</line>
   <line>He ever talk about a girl named Sherry?
- Beats me.</line>
   <line>Any girls at all?
- Look, I don't know.</line>
   <line>Some of the humps around here
give him a hard time about that,</line>
   <line>he's not George Clooney.</line>
   <line>Excuse me.</line>
   <line>Lilly Rush.</line>
   <line>I saw you at the apartment.</line>
   <line>So, you stuck around, huh?</line>
   <line>You were watching?</line>
   <line>Now there's a cop out front.
I can't get back in.</line>
   <line>It's not just your house, James.
There's an APB out on you.</line>
   <line>What'll happen to her body?</line>
   <line>What do you want to happen?</line>
   <line>I thought maybe</line>
   <line>bury her at the County Cemetery.</line>
   <line>Don't think so.</line>
   <line>Why not?
- I'm not trying to upset you,</line>
   <line>but, uh, if next of kin
doesn't claim the body,</line>
   <line>the coroner has procedures.</line>
   <line>Like what?</line>
   <line>Oh, he'll cremate her, then, uh,
put her remains in a plastic bag.</line>
   <line>Probably stamp on a ticket number
or some ID, then box it up</line>
   <line>and stuff it away
in a warehouse somewhere.</line>
   <line>You wanna come in, James?</line>
   <line>Talk face-to-face?</line>
   <line>We can see about a real funeral
for grandma that way.</line>
   <line>Do you really get dark moods
or were you just conning me?</line>
   <line>Wish I was conning you.</line>
   <line>Look, you can talk to me.</line>
   <line>Don't you feel that?</line>
   <line>Yes.</line>
   <line>So, come in. We'll talk.</line>
   <line>About what?</line>
   <line>How about... Sherry?</line>
   <line>Sore subject?</line>
   <line>Off-limits.</line>
   <line>Maybe because she's no longer a Fox.</line>
   <line>She goes by Mrs. Stephens now.
Lives on the Main Line.</line>
   <line>Nice digs.</line>
   <line>Marry on OB-GYN,
and you can have this, too.</line>
   <line>This is a mistake.</line>
   <line>There was no homicide.
James's grandma went missing.</line>
   <line>Well, this ain't a mistake.</line>
   <line>Have you seen James recently?</line>
   <line>Talked to him?</line>
   <line>Not in three years.</line>
   <line>Still, this doesn't make sense.</line>
   <line>But you two were involved, right?</line>
   <line>Well, he was my boyfriend.
We lived together forever.</line>
   <line>You break up with him?</line>
   <line>We met a bowling alley.</line>
   <line>At the time, that kind of
life was really fun to me.</line>
   <line>Ten years later, it wasn't.</line>
   <line>How long till you got married?</line>
   <line>A year.
- That's pretty quick.</line>
   <line>Doesn't seem so quick
when you're over .</line>
   <line>Sherry, going back, were you around
when Krystal supposedly went missing?</line>
   <line>Mm, not the exact day.</line>
   <line>But I was staying over a lot.
- What was that like?</line>
   <line>How do you mean?
- Before Krystal was gone.</line>
   <line>Sleeping over with grandma
in the house?</line>
   <line>Mostly okay.</line>
   <line>But sometimes not.</line>
   <line>Let's go upstairs.
- No, it'll be better here.</line>
   <line>What if Krystal comes in?</line>
   <line>Let her.</line>
   <line>No, come on.</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>Times change, grandma.</line>
   <line>You gotta accept that things
ain't like when you were a kid.</line>
   <line>I just came to give you
a check for groceries.</line>
   <line>You don't like it here, grandma,</line>
   <line>I can make other
arrangements for you.</line>
   <line>But James threatened to put her
in a home, not m*rder her.</line>
   <line>Now, Krystal was chipping
in on the bills, right?</line>
   <line>She didn't mind helping
when James got in a pinch.</line>
   <line>Well, please tell me
he's not in trouble.</line>
   <line>Wish I could.</line>
   <line>Thanks for your time.</line>
   <line>So, she outgrew the guy.</line>
   <line>He's still pining for her
all these years later.</line>
   <line>Most people get over this stuff.</line>
   <line>She left him three years ago,
grandma died years ago,</line>
   <line>but I still don't get why he's
reaching out today.</line>
   <line>Where you headed?
- Due in court.</line>
   <line>Drop by social security for me?</line>
   <line>Uh, not my favorite joint.
What do you need?</line>
   <line>Well, it took five years
before the court declared
Krystal Hogan dead,</line>
   <line>and six years before James
collected the life insurance.</line>
   <line>So, in the meantime,
you think he was picking up
her benefit checks?</line>
   <line>Easy scam to pull off.</line>
   <line>Sherry said grandma had
some cash floating around.</line>
   <line>So, what about Krystal's
bank records?</line>
   <line>Already put out a subpoena.
- All right.</line>
   <line>Rush.</line>
   <line>Yeah?</line>
   <line>Remember when I ran
James through NCIC, PCIC?</line>
   <line>Yeah, he was clean.</line>
   <line>Yeah, well, I got his social,
I ran him again. Got an as*ault charge.</line>
   <line>Why didn't it show up earlier?</line>
   <line>He wasn't charged under
the name James Hogan.</line>
   <line>He was charged under
the name James Gable.</line>
   <line>Gable? / Half-brother
to the victim, Lonnie Gable.</line>
   <line>So he has some family after all.</line>
   <line>I don't know if Lonnie's
gonna see it that way.</line>
   <line>What did James do to him?</line>
   <line>Beat on him... with a brick.</line>
   <line>James was using your last name?</line>
   <line>Cause I bought him his first car.</line>
   <line>I told him not to do that.
- Sounds like you looked out for him.</line>
   <line>He was my little brother.</line>
   <line>So, how did he end up
alone with Krystal?</line>
   <line>I was in Baltimore,
working for a mortgage company.</line>
   <line>When Mom died in that wreck,
I came back.</line>
   <line>I didn't wanna move in.</line>
   <line>I've got a life. But I told him
to get live-in help for her.</line>
   <line>He didn't wanna do that?
- I couldn't force him.</line>
   <line>She was his grandma, not mine.</line>
   <line>Actually, he and the old girl
got along pretty good.</line>
   <line>He always said how much he liked
his talks with her.</line>
   <line>I lived nearby, I figured I could
look over his shoulder.</line>
   <line>But then you two had that falling out.</line>
   <line>He was begging for me to meet Sherry.</line>
   <line>You weren't too high on her?</line>
   <line>I had them over for a barbecue.
She's nice, whatever.</line>
   <line>Then suddenly she says that she
wants this certain wine cooler,</line>
   <line>so James goes on a run.</line>
   <line>For the next minutes,
this girl goes on parade.</line>
   <line>Flirting, prancing, bending over...</line>
   <line>real intentional...
showing me the world.</line>
   <line>I just look away, whatever.</line>
   <line>And then she says
will I take her away to New York?</line>
   <line>It was such a sideways
thing to say, I just laugh,</line>
   <line>and she follows it up with,</line>
   <line>whatever you want,
wherever you want,</line>
   <line>for the rest of your life.</line>
   <line>So, then what happened?</line>
   <line>I got her the hell out of my yard.</line>
   <line>James comes back, I figure I better
tell him before she starts lying,</line>
   <line>then I'm fixing up.</line>
   <line>You can guess the rest.</line>
   <line>He opened you up pretty good.</line>
   <line>So, why did you pull back on
pressing charges?</line>
   <line>What, am I going to send him to jail?</line>
   <line>I figure it's best just to
walk away and not look back.</line>
   <line>The shocking thing was</line>
   <line>he was really fond of Krystal.</line>
   <line>Krystal's benefit checks were
$ a month.</line>
   <line>Good bank for a -year-old.</line>
   <line>And they flowed in long
after her death.</line>
   <line>These here are dated before the m*rder.
That's Krystal's signature.</line>
   <line>The rest are dated after she died.</line>
   <line>I know that writing.</line>
   <line>See the little tails on both S's?
- Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line>Did Sherry endorse these checks?</line>
   <line>Well, let me send it over to
Questioned Documents. / Thanks.</line>
   <line>What if Sherry orchestrated this?
- The fraud or the m*rder?</line>
   <line>Or both.</line>
   <line>So, you're saying</line>
   <line>Lonnie's story is starting
to ring true?</line>
   <line>Well, these checks showed
she was no angel.</line>
   <line>and if James got on so well with
grandma the way Lonnie says...</line>
   <line>Plus your crush on him.</line>
   <line>James just got sloppy.</line>
   <line>See if you can ID this.
- - - - .</line>
   <line>Hello. / What did Sherry say to you?</line>
   <line>You gonna follow me, James,
you might as well just come in.</line>
   <line>Tell me.</line>
   <line>Cops get information,
they don't give it.</line>
   <line>I wasn't following you.</line>
   <line>You asked about Sherry,
so I knew you'd go see her.</line>
   <line>But you were there.</line>
   <line>I was around.
- You around Sherry's house a lot?</line>
   <line>Do not accuse me of that.
I know what you're accusing me of.</line>
   <line>Then help me understand, James.</line>
   <line>I'm not a stalker.</line>
   <line>That was the first time
I've ever gone by.</line>
   <line>Only once in three years?</line>
   <line>I've been doing what you're
supposed to do. I'm working.</line>
   <line>I haven't been in trouble.
You can check.</line>
   <line>I did.</line>
   <line>It's true.
- Okay, then.</line>
   <line>So, why are you flipping
out today, James?</line>
   <line>What happen to make it today?</line>
   <line>I don't wanna tell you that.</line>
   <line>Everything she used to give me,</line>
   <line>I don't have anymore.</line>
   <line>But that's not new.</line>
   <line>That's a three-year-old problem.</line>
   <line>Tell me what she said.
Please.</line>
   <line>She was trying to protect you.
- She was?</line>
   <line>She said she didn't think you did it.</line>
   <line>Really?</line>
   <line>I'm wondering if she was
trying to fake me out.</line>
   <line>If maybe she was... part of it?</line>
   <line>No. No.</line>
   <line>I've been finding out a lot of things.</line>
   <line>What things?</line>
   <line>I know she signed Krystal's checks.</line>
   <line>That's forgery.
- No, that was me.</line>
   <line>Looked like her handwriting.
And according to your brother,</line>
   <line>Sherry isn't as reputable
as she plays up to be.</line>
   <line>Son of a b*tch.
He's a liar.</line>
   <line>You saying she never knew?</line>
   <line>Never talked about how great
it would be to collect grandma's money?</line>
   <line>Just got cash from you,
never asked where it came from?</line>
   <line>She'd say things.</line>
   <line>Okay.</line>
   <line>But Sherry says things she doesn't mean.</line>
   <line>Don't move.</line>
   <line>Why? / The way the light's hitting.</line>
   <line>You're my handsome man.
- Don't say that.</line>
   <line>No one's better on the inside,
hear me?</line>
   <line>I see the way you take
care of your grandma.</line>
   <line>Sometimes I'm not sure
I'm living up, you know?</line>
   <line>You see how she watches
the preachers all day?</line>
   <line>All she wants is peace.</line>
   <line>I do sort of feel that.</line>
   <line>It's no accident she waits
for you to open her mail,</line>
   <line>always letting you know
that money's come.</line>
   <line>The same joke every time.</line>
   <line>What good's money to a worn-out
bag of bones?</line>
   <line>She's not gonna come
right out and say it.</line>
   <line>You gotta read between
the lines, dariln'?</line>
   <line>I don't think I could ever do that.</line>
   <line>Of course you couldn't.</line>
   <line>See, with her it was just talk.</line>
   <line>She manipulated you, James.</line>
   <line>You need to see that.</line>
   <line>He's at the bus station.</line>
   <line>Hello?</line>
   <line>You've been conning me.</line>
   <line>What?
- Yeah.</line>
   <line>No. / I can tell.
I can see it on your face.</line>
   <line>Police! Don't move!</line>
   <line>Rush!</line>
   <line>It's not him.</line>
   <line>James kills grandma for Sherry,</line>
   <line>so he can afford to take her
nicer places than bowling.</line>
   <line>And make her the new lady of the house.
- Or Sherry put him up to it.</line>
   <line>Or does the deed herself.</line>
   <line>Those are the scenarios.</line>
   <line>Do we know how grandma died?</line>
   <line>Autopsy made a positive ID.
No cause of death determined.</line>
   <line>Heard from James lately?</line>
   <line>No. He's pissed at me
'cause I bad-mouthed Sherry.</line>
   <line>Hope I didn't take it too far.</line>
   <line>It's been hours.</line>
   <line>You're gonna love this.</line>
   <line>Sherry had four sets of parents,
all before she was years old.</line>
   <line>Foster homes.
- Yeah, then runaway.</line>
   <line>On the streets and who knows what,
till she meets James.</line>
   <line>Any record?
- Shoplifting.</line>
   <line>Well, she's a survivor.</line>
   <line>She finds James,
a -year-old with a house.</line>
   <line>Moves up to a doctor
on the Main Line.</line>
   <line>Aw, sooki-sooki.</line>
   <line>Where you going?</line>
   <line>Pharmacy run.</line>
   <line>Thought your sister was
taking care of your mother.</line>
   <line>AWOL since last week.</line>
   <line>Detective.</line>
   <line>Lonnie.</line>
   <line>What happened?</line>
   <line>I was going to my car,
and James jumps me.</line>
   <line>Keeps going on and on
about Sherry and her pure heart,</line>
   <line>what a lout I am...
all the old stuff.</line>
   <line>I'm sorry.
You can press charges.</line>
   <line>No, that's not what I want.</line>
   <line>But I didn't lay down.</line>
   <line>Me and him, we had it out.</line>
   <line>And we talked, too.
- You talked?</line>
   <line>About him coming in.
I'm not gonna walk away again.</line>
   <line>But I want him brought in safe.</line>
   <line>I'm working hard to do that.</line>
   <line>No, I mean I've set it up.</line>
   <line>He's agreed to meet.</line>
   <line>But only with you.</line>
   <line>Lonnie okay?</line>
   <line>Fair.</line>
   <line>I'm such a jerk.</line>
   <line>I shouldn't have hurt him.</line>
   <line>You gotta control yourself, James.</line>
   <line>I don't know why he keeps telling
that lie about Sherry.</line>
   <line>What's the plan now, James?</line>
   <line>I wanna turn myself in.</line>
   <line>Good.
- One condition.</line>
   <line>I'm listening.</line>
   <line>You guarantee me
you'll leave Sherry alone.</line>
   <line>She's not part of this.
- If that's true,</line>
   <line>you have your guarantee.</line>
   <line>No! Certain things
will look bad for her.</line>
   <line>You're already thinking that way.</line>
   <line>James, every cop in Philly
has an eye out.</line>
   <line>Some are inexperienced.
Don't let this end badly.</line>
   <line>Right now, we go in safe.
- This was a bad idea.</line>
   <line>You ever ask her to marry you?</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>You were together a long time.</line>
   <line>You ask her to wear your ring?</line>
   <line>Yes.</line>
   <line>She said no, huh?
- She had her reasons.</line>
   <line>Whatever they were,
she quit you.</line>
   <line>So, why protect her now?</line>
   <line>I know what you're doing.
You're trying to tear her down.</line>
   <line>I just don't think Lonnie
was lying about her, James.</line>
   <line>She was my girl.</line>
   <line>She believed in me.</line>
   <line>And that may not be big to you,
but it is to me.</line>
   <line>And not just when we were together.</line>
   <line>More so since we've been apart.</line>
   <line>How's that work?</line>
   <line>She told me that for
the rest of her life,</line>
   <line>who took care of her like I did.</line>
   <line>That that's the man I am.</line>
   <line>Even now, I know she believes in me.</line>
   <line>So why do you believe in her?</line>
   <line>She's gone.</line>
   <line>What do you know about it?</line>
   <line>I know Lonnie wasn't lying that
day you hit him with the brick.</line>
   <line>And so do you.</line>
   <line>She didn't love you, James.</line>
   <line>And I'm your girl now.</line>
   <line>So, Sherry's coming in?</line>
   <line>She's one powerful girl.</line>
   <line>James is still hanging on
to what she said at the kiss-off.</line>
   <line>While she's kicking back on
the Main Line with Dr. Stephens.</line>
   <line>Oh, I have some new interesting
information about Sherry and doctors.</line>
   <line>Care for a coke, coffee?
- I'm good, thanks.</line>
   <line>Husband bring you in?</line>
   <line>Yeah, he doesn't like
me driving in the city.</line>
   <line>How'd you meet your husband?</line>
   <line>He was my doctor.</line>
   <line>Out in Merion?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>where you and James lived.</line>
   <line>So?</line>
   <line>I noticed your dentist,
dermatologist...</line>
   <line>all your health care takes
place out in the suburbs.</line>
   <line>I live in the suburbs.
- Well, now you do.</line>
   <line>But you started with all these doctors
while you were still in Germantown.</line>
   <line>All your doctors are male,
aren't they?</line>
   <line>I don't get your meaning.
- Nothing. No meaning.</line>
   <line>Here's what bugs me.</line>
   <line>You and Jimmy together...
I ain't seeing it.</line>
   <line>I mean, you're a head turner.</line>
   <line>Him... he's a shlub.
And that's not a shot.</line>
   <line>I mean, you're out of
my league, too, but...</line>
   <line>How a man looks has
never mattered to me?</line>
   <line>Lonnie's pretty good-looking.</line>
   <line>Not with that scar, he isn't.</line>
   <line>No remorse for having
caused that scar?</line>
   <line>Caused?
- Oh, we've been talking to Lonnie.</line>
   <line>He gave us the whole
sh**ting match, babe.</line>
   <line>Well, the next time you see Lonnie,</line>
   <line>tell him to have another drink.</line>
   <line>Recognize this?</line>
   <line>I guess it looks like
a letter I wrote.</line>
   <line>You talk about being tense.
Over what?</line>
   <line>Who knows?
That was years ago.</line>
   <line>Let's move up in the world.
Anything on that?</line>
   <line>I have goals.
Let's try and... do well.</line>
   <line>A driven person, aren't you, Sherry?
- Sure, no question.</line>
   <line>Comming up hard the way you did,
you'd have to be, right?</line>
   <line>What would you know about it?
- Nothing.</line>
   <line>I came up in a real sound situation.</line>
   <line>Not like you.</line>
   <line>You had it hard scrabble.</line>
   <line>You had to fight your way to
the Main Line.</line>
   <line>Did you ask James to get rid of
his grandma in this letter?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>What did you mean by asking him
to read between the lines?</line>
   <line>That all grandma wanted was peace?</line>
   <line>N-Nothing. I-I don't even
remember saying that.</line>
   <line>You must have loved sharing
a bathroom with an -year-old woman.</line>
   <line>I liked Krystal.
- But she was old.</line>
   <line>Already lived a full life.</line>
   <line>She'd had her time.
Now it was your time, right?</line>
   <line>Before I was a cop, Sherry,
I worked in Questioned Documents.</line>
   <line>Handwriting Specialist.</line>
   <line>Board certified.</line>
   <line>So? / So this isn't Krystal's signature.</line>
   <line>This is you signing Krystal's name.</line>
   <line>You're wrong.</line>
   <line>Board certified, Sherry.</line>
   <line>Did you get her to go?</line>
   <line>For the fraud.
- Won't go for the m*rder.</line>
   <line>Rush.</line>
   <line>I'm calling to say good-bye.</line>
   <line>It was messed up.
I open the door,</line>
   <line>and it's that James dude
from the other day.</line>
   <line>And he was armed?
- Had the double-barrel all busted out.</line>
   <line>Told us to leave.
- Guy took the place. That was it.</line>
   <line>I gotta get inside.
- Well, SWAT wants to wait, Lil.</line>
   <line>We can't wait.</line>
   <line>You gotta go to bat for me.</line>
   <line>James.</line>
   <line>Can you hear me?</line>
   <line>I hear you.</line>
   <line>Hey...</line>
   <line>I wanna come around this corner...</line>
   <line>but I know you have a g*n.</line>
   <line>I'm not gonna hurt you.
- I believe you...</line>
   <line>but you need to put the g*n down.</line>
   <line>I'm gonna show you my g*n, okay?</line>
   <line>Then you show yours.</line>
   <line>James?</line>
   <line>Just don't ask me to give it to you.</line>
   <line>Deal.</line>
   <line>Say it again, will you?</line>
   <line>Say what again?</line>
   <line>My name.
You always say my name.</line>
   <line>James.</line>
   <line>Sherry would never call me that.</line>
   <line>No?</line>
   <line>What, then?</line>
   <line>Hon... or baby...</line>
   <line>or darlin', mostly. Darlin'.</line>
   <line>That's nice.</line>
   <line>No, but, sometimes you wanna
hear your name,</line>
   <line>you know, and she would never say it.</line>
   <line>I'd ask, but she said
it make her feel awkward.</line>
   <line>Who I am made her feel awkward...</line>
   <line>Should've known back then, right?</line>
   <line>No, she's...</line>
   <line>...good, James.</line>
   <line>Clever.</line>
   <line>I feel like I can really talk to you.
- Keep that g*n down.</line>
   <line>Do you like talking to me?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>I do.</line>
   <line>I did a bad thing.</line>
   <line>Do you want more?</line>
   <line>There's no shame in scrubbing floors.
If only my knees knew it.</line>
   <line>Let me help.
- Oh, thank you.</line>
   <line>You know, I used to run like the wind.
Did you know that?</line>
   <line>Look at me now.</line>
   <line>Are you sad, Grandma?</line>
   <line>Of course I'm sad,</line>
   <line>but this is the way
it's supposed to be.</line>
   <line>We're meant to wear
ourselves out, James.</line>
   <line>That's what the Lord expects.</line>
   <line>Here, lift your head.</line>
   <line>Lay back.</line>
   <line>Close your eyes.</line>
   <line>Finish.</line>
   <line>Huh?</line>
   <line>You have to finish telling.</line>
   <line>You have to face it.</line>
   <line>Here, lift your head.</line>
   <line>It's for the best.</line>
   <line>You didn't k*ll her.</line>
   <line>Sherry did.</line>
   <line>No, it's still the same.</line>
   <line>I put her in the basement.</line>
   <line>I dumped her here...</line>
   <line>like potatoes.</line>
   <line>It's the same.</line>
   <line>Worse...</line>
   <line>for you.</line>
   <line>In your mind, it's worse...</line>
   <line>because you let it happen.</line>
   <line>That's what's eaten you,
what you didn't do.</line>
   <line>My God. Oh, God. Oh, God.</line>
   <line>Oh, God.
- Don't.</line>
   <line>- su1c1de's not the way, James.
- I'm executing myself.</line>
   <line>I deserve to die for what I did.
- Look at me.</line>
   <line>James.</line>
   <line>Why'd you start this?</line>
   <line>Sherry left you, and for three years,
no trouble, so why'd you call?</line>
   <line>I wasn't getting over things
the way you're supposed to.</line>
   <line>You couldn't move on.</line>
   <line>And it was just...
the final straw last week.</line>
   <line>What was?</line>
   <line>James... give me an answer.</line>
   <line>Give me an answer!</line>
   <line>I was working down the road...</line>
   <line>With the movers.</line>
   <line>and I-I was, like, three doors down,</line>
   <line>so I figured, 'Let me
come pay my respects',</line>
   <line>and the kid you know... he lets me
come down here and-and-and look.</line>
   <line>Look?</line>
   <line>Look at this place.
It's a party place...</line>
   <line>and, the kid was telling me
all the things they do down here,</line>
   <line>and my grandma's underneath
them the whole time</line>
   <line>under this cheesy bar...</line>
   <line>and I put her there!</line>
   <line>And I looked in this beer mirror...</line>
   <line>and I thought, I am a disgrace.</line>
   <line>I'm a disgrace.</line>
   <line>James...</line>
   <line>You're not a disgrace.</line>
   <line>You have regret.</line>
   <line>You're facing that night.</line>
   <line>Who says that counts for anything?</line>
   <line>That's up to you...</line>
   <line>but it counts for me.</line>
