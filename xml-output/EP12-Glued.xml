   <line>Two bucks.
- Here you go.</line>
   <line>Thanks.</line>
   <line>Buck .</line>
   <line>I only have a dollar.</line>
   <line>Is this for school?
- Yeah.</line>
   <line>All right, then.</line>
   <line>Education's important.</line>
   <line>You don't wanna end up like
those mutts on the corner.</line>
   <line>Get outta here.</line>
   <line>And be careful.
- Thanks, mister.</line>
   <line>Boss!</line>
   <line>Takeout's getting cold.</line>
   <line>Vera's wolfing down the last of
the sweet and sour. / Okay.</line>
   <line>The Sixers traded Allen Iverson.</line>
   <line>Uh-huh.</line>
   <line>Boss...</line>
   <line>Oh, thanks, Lil.</line>
   <line>I'm not hungry.</line>
   <line>You got something on a cold one?</line>
   <line>No, I just come down to take a look at
that case every once in a while.</line>
   <line>Any reason?</line>
   <line>Tender age.
The kid was eight.</line>
   <line>Your job?</line>
   <line>No...No!</line>
   <line>No!</line>
   <line>No!</line>
   <line>My little boy!</line>
   <line>Calm down, please ,sir.</line>
   <line>Any good leads?
- Oh, plenty. None panned out.</line>
   <line>Three black teenagers were main suspects.</line>
   <line>We nearly had a race riot
in the neighborhood when the kid died.</line>
   <line>You wanna take a look at it?</line>
   <line>You got something new on it?</line>
   <line>No. You get fresh eyes.</line>
   <line>Maybe you'll see something I missed.</line>
   <line>Any reason you're looking back now?
Today?</line>
   <line>What am I, one of your suspects?</line>
   <line>Well, you're avoiding my questions like one?</line>
   <line>All right.</line>
   <line>I can take a hint.</line>
   <line>Be mysterious.</line>
   <line>Tim Barnes was hit once in the face
below the right eye,</line>
   <line>presumably knocked unconscious.</line>
   <line>He died of hypothermia.
- No prints, no witnesses.</line>
   <line>The lead suspect
was a -year-old glue-sniffer</line>
   <line>named Latrell Richmond.</line>
   <line>Juvenile record of as*ault and burglary.</line>
   <line>He and his pals hung out
at a corner by the store</line>
   <line>where Tim Barnes bought that notebook.</line>
   <line>You interview him?</line>
   <line>That night.</line>
   <line>So after the boy goes into the store?</line>
   <line>I saw him leave.</line>
   <line>Headed north on Grover.</line>
   <line>What did you do after you saw the boy
walking north on Grover?</line>
   <line>Nothing. Chilled.</line>
   <line>You didn't follow him,
maybe try and rob him?</line>
   <line>You deaf, Still-man?</line>
   <line>I gotta repeat everything?</line>
   <line>Anyone see you chillin'
on the corner, Latrell?</line>
   <line>Other than your two friends?</line>
   <line>No, it was... it was cold out.</line>
   <line>Nobody was out.
- What about Mr. Murphy, the store clerk?</line>
   <line>He see you chillin'?
- How do I know?</line>
   <line>I stayed away from that white boy.</line>
   <line>just like the Philly PD.</line>
   <line>We released him into
his mother's custody.</line>
   <line>We were gonna box him in the morning,</line>
   <line>How about his two friends?</line>
   <line>They were polygraphed.
Both passed.</line>
   <line>One is dead now, and the other's
serving time, won't talk to cops.</line>
   <line>Latrell's mom around?
- Yeah, she and his two sisters always</line>
   <line>claimed they had no
idea where he went.</line>
   <line>Let's fan out.</line>
   <line>I'll go to the parents.
You go to the store clerk.</line>
   <line>The clerk was the
last to see Tim alive?</line>
   <line>Yep.</line>
   <line>Maybe Jeffries and Vera
can pay Latrell's family a visit.</line>
   <line>Good.</line>
   <line>Tim loved delivering the mail
with his dad in the summer.</line>
   <line>Your other two?</line>
   <line>Uh, that's Tina in California.</line>
   <line>She's a vet now, lives in Modesto.</line>
   <line>And that's Brian, he's my youngest.</line>
   <line>He's a law student of Syracus.</line>
   <line>Oh, Greg, honey.</line>
   <line>Uh, this is Detective Rush.
She's here about Tim.</line>
   <line>What about him? / I'd like to talk to you
about the night he was k*lled.</line>
   <line>Lieutenant Stillman sent me.</line>
   <line>He's lieutenant now, huh?
- Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line>He was a nice man.</line>
   <line>I told her it was okay.
I can handle it.</line>
   <line>All right.</line>
   <line>You wanna know what happened
that night, I'll tell you.</line>
   <line>Once.</line>
   <line>Hey, mom, can I go to the store
to buy a notebook for math?</line>
   <line>Ask your father.
- I got a dollar. I'll pay for it.</line>
   <line>I said ask your father.</line>
   <line>Dad, that hurt.
- Hey, dad,</line>
   <line>can I go to the store to buy a notebook
for math class? / Stop it! Stop it!</line>
   <line>Tina, your hair's gotta be washed.</line>
   <line>Dad. / No, it doesn't.</line>
   <line>Dad.
- What?</line>
   <line>Can I go to the store
to buy a notebook?</line>
   <line>Ask your mother.
- But she said to ask you.</line>
   <line>Are we done, Daddy?</line>
   <line>Stop squirming.</line>
   <line>Forget you.</line>
   <line>Tina, stop squirming.</line>
   <line>You have kids...
Detective?</line>
   <line>Because you don't know
the meaning of exhausion</line>
   <line>until you've had a colicky newborn
on top of two others.</line>
   <line>We were outgunned,
weren't we, honey?</line>
   <line>Three against two.</line>
   <line>How much time passed
before you noticed Tim was missing?</line>
   <line>Um... two...</line>
   <line>two and a half hours.</line>
   <line>That's how nuts we were.</line>
   <line>Then what'd you do?
- We called Tim's friends.</line>
   <line>Um, checked around the block,</line>
   <line>and pretty soon we got scared,
so we called the cops.</line>
   <line>By the time they found him...</line>
   <line>Tim was frozen to death.</line>
   <line>If we would have just
noticed him missing earlier...</line>
   <line>It's okay, sweetie.</line>
   <line>Like I said, once is all
I'm gonna tell that story.</line>
   <line>Hey, hey! Hey!</line>
   <line>Watch that.</line>
   <line>Wilma Richmond?</line>
   <line>Detectives Vera, Jeffries.</line>
   <line>My daughters told me you called them.</line>
   <line>You ain't gonna get nothing outta me
you didn't get outta my girls.</line>
   <line>Think maybe we can
come in, Ms. Wilma?</line>
   <line>Yeah, we are, uh, sitting ducks out here.
- And it's cold.</line>
   <line>Don't bother the kids none.</line>
   <line>Besides, you got blubber on you.</line>
   <line>We'll only be a minute.</line>
   <line>So your daughters say
they haven't seen Latrell</line>
   <line>since the night he disappeard in .</line>
   <line>Ditto.
- No phone calls, letters?</line>
   <line>What did I just say?</line>
   <line>Besides, if I knew
where Latrell was,</line>
   <line>which I don't,
you think I'd tell you?</line>
   <line>Don't hear me wrong?
I feel bad for that family,</line>
   <line>but they're not the only ones
lost a boy that night.</line>
   <line>I lost my son the same
as they lost theirs.</line>
   <line>So what happened that night,</line>
   <line>after you brought Latrell home
from Homicide?</line>
   <line>I don't like to think
about that night.</line>
   <line>We can understand that.
- Oh, yeah?</line>
   <line>You lost a boy, Detective?</line>
   <line>No, ma'am. / Then why are you
talking about understanding?</line>
   <line>Trell was my eldest,</line>
   <line>the man of the house,</line>
   <line>but he was still just a boy.</line>
   <line>We'll get us a lawyer, Trell.</line>
   <line>You ain't gotta run.</line>
   <line>We can't afford no lawyer.</line>
   <line>Where are you gonna go?</line>
   <line>Don't know, but if I stay here,
the police'll beat my a*s till I confess,</line>
   <line>You know they will.</line>
   <line>You got any money?
- No.</line>
   <line>Here.</line>
   <line>I'm not cleaning you out, Mom.
- Take it.</line>
   <line>years old.</line>
   <line>Can you imagine how scared he was?</line>
   <line>Your grandkids?</line>
   <line>From my daughters.</line>
   <line>Thank God I at least have them.</line>
   <line>Now if you don't mind,</line>
   <line>why don't you go harass some
other innocent black people?</line>
   <line>Sean Murphy.</line>
   <line>Call me Murph-- everyone does.</line>
   <line>You're a long way from clerking
at the five-and-dime, Murph.</line>
   <line>That's what a little hard work can do.</line>
   <line>So...</line>
   <line>this is about Tim Barnes?</line>
   <line>I understand you were the last
person to see him alive.</line>
   <line>Aside from whoever k*lled him.</line>
   <line>He bought some from your store?</line>
   <line>A black-and-white composition book.</line>
   <line>Was Tim a kid you knew from
the neighborhood?</line>
   <line>He came into the store occasionally,</line>
   <line>never had enough money.</line>
   <line>I'd let him slide.</line>
   <line>Felt sorry for him.</line>
   <line>Why is that?</line>
   <line>There were these black
kids in the area.</line>
   <line>I think they were picking on him.</line>
   <line>They do that a lot?</line>
   <line>They were always hanging
around the corner, harassing people.</line>
   <line>Mutts had the lazy gene,
if you know what I mean.</line>
   <line>You see Tim with them mutts that night?</line>
   <line>You bet I did.</line>
   <line>They ever bother you?</line>
   <line>No, they knew better.</line>
   <line>You know this guy?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Yeah, he was the ringleader of those kids.</line>
   <line>Laquanda or something.
- Latrell.</line>
   <line>You didn't actually see him or any of
his pals hurt the boy though, did you?</line>
   <line>If I would have seen something,
I would have intervened.</line>
   <line>I would have kick those...</line>
   <line>African-American young
gentlemen's asses.</line>
   <line>The Barnes speak highly of you.</line>
   <line>How are they doing?</line>
   <line>Getting by, I guess.</line>
   <line>That kind of wound doesn't heal.</line>
   <line>I used to call them a lot.</line>
   <line>I stopped when I didn't have
anything new to tell them.</line>
   <line>You buying baby furniture?
- No, it's my daughter.</line>
   <line>She's pregnant.
- How far along?</line>
   <line>A couple of months.
I just found out.</line>
   <line>Anything from Latrell's family?</line>
   <line>Mother and sisters are
sticking to their stories.</line>
   <line>You think he could be dead?</line>
   <line>I doubt it. Latrell
was a survivor of sorts.</line>
   <line>So is that the new direction?</line>
   <line>Hearing your daughter's pregnant?</line>
   <line>It got me thinking
about this case, yeah,</line>
   <line>and feeling guilty.</line>
   <line>About what? / I was working the
Barnes job when my daughter was born.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I missed her birth completely.</line>
   <line>My wife, uh, wasn't pleased.</line>
   <line>I lost my marriage over a case
I couldn't even solve.</line>
   <line>Well, no wonder you
don't want back on it.</line>
   <line>The sad part is, I do, though.</line>
   <line>I want this thing solved.
I want it put to rest.</line>
   <line>I get it.</line>
   <line>No, you don't,</line>
   <line>but you will one day.</line>
   <line>Hopefully before I did.</line>
   <line>Murphy's a piece of work;
into genetics racial superiority.</line>
   <line>He thinks Latrell's the doer?</line>
   <line>ID'ed him off his picture
in a second flat.</line>
   <line>We got something.</line>
   <line>Latrell's two sisters, Lisa and Leslie.</line>
   <line>They got three kids apiece.</line>
   <line>But according to Wilma Richmond,
she has seven grandkids.</line>
   <line>Yeah, so who's lucky number seven?</line>
   <line>Thinking maybe he's Latrell's?</line>
   <line>We're gonna find out.</line>
   <line>We're on the street, boss.</line>
   <line>Us, too.</line>
   <line>Going to the crime scene.
- Good.</line>
   <line>Ain't too often we got the Assigned
available to go with us. / Uh-huh</line>
   <line>Come on, boss.</line>
   <line>Be a big help.</line>
   <line>I'll get my coat.</line>
   <line>Used to be a working
class neighborhood...</line>
   <line>half black, half white.</line>
   <line>A lot of racial tension.</line>
   <line>This is where Tim died.</line>
   <line>Except he was lying in snow, not slush.</line>
   <line>That coffee shop there
was a five-and-dime</line>
   <line>where Tim Barnes bought his notebook.</line>
   <line>Where Murphy worked.</line>
   <line>In this corner right here,</line>
   <line>this is where Latrell and
his pals were sniffing glue.</line>
   <line>Even the church is getting a facelift.</line>
   <line>The Barnes were Catholics, right?</line>
   <line>Yeah, Tim was in the boys' choir.</line>
   <line>You talk to the priest?
- Yeah. Father Declan.</line>
   <line>He was in the church that night,
but he didn't see or hear anything.</line>
   <line>There wasn't a pedophilia scandal
back in , was there?</line>
   <line>No. Just pedophilia.</line>
   <line>Oh, what, the guy's a priest,
so automatically he's a pedophile?</line>
   <line>No, but don't we gotta look at it?</line>
   <line>Well, he was close to the family,
both the parents and the kids.</line>
   <line>Diocese won't disclose the priest's
whereabouts without a court order.</line>
   <line>You got a relationship
with ADA Kite, right?</line>
   <line>What do you mean, a relationship?</line>
   <line>I mean, maybe you can give him a call.</line>
   <line>He could help us, uh,
cut through the red tape.</line>
   <line>Yeah, I... could call him.</line>
   <line>Did a search of Latrell's
mother's phone records.</line>
   <line>Other than her daughters,
one other name comes up consistently.</line>
   <line>It's Candace Smith.</line>
   <line>Who's that? / -year-old nurse
with a -year-old boy.</line>
   <line>Wilma Richmond had a picture
of her kid in her apartment.</line>
   <line>Looks to be about .
- The seventh grandkid?</line>
   <line>Latrell's, maybe.
With Candace.</line>
   <line>Wilma told you to talk to me?</line>
   <line>We're here about her son, Latrell.</line>
   <line>Latrell?</line>
   <line>Well, that's a name I
haven't heard in a long time.</line>
   <line>Um...</line>
   <line>this is a picture of him.</line>
   <line>That there was Latrell.</line>
   <line>A couple of names back, that is.</line>
   <line>When I married him, he was
going by Julius Smith.</line>
   <line>Your boy sure looks like him.</line>
   <line>Don't remind me.</line>
   <line>You wouldn't happen to know
where Julius is, would you?</line>
   <line>Michael,
wanna give us some privacy?</line>
   <line>Like I never heard you
badmouthing Julius before.</line>
   <line>Go.</line>
   <line>Julius Smith is a low-rent,
two-timing,</line>
   <line>piss-poor excuse of a man.</line>
   <line>Kicked his worthless butt
out the door six years ago.</line>
   <line>He doesn't call,</line>
   <line>Child support?</line>
   <line>The day he left,
he cleaned me and Michael out.</line>
   <line>Took his own son's GameBoy.</line>
   <line>He an addict?
- Addict, dealer.</line>
   <line>Last I heard, he was hustling
out of the Badlands.</line>
   <line>But what did he do now?</line>
   <line>You know what? Don't tell me.</line>
   <line>I don't want to know.</line>
   <line>You find Julius Latrell--</line>
   <line>whatever the hell his name is,</line>
   <line>tell him his son's a straight-A student.</line>
   <line>He's grown up to be a real man,</line>
   <line>not like his lying a*s.</line>
   <line>Yes, ma'am, we most definitely will.</line>
   <line>I went to law school with Sherman Markey,
one of the diocese's attorneys.</line>
   <line>He spared us the rigmarole.</line>
   <line>Your Father Declan's in a retirement home
for priests put out to pasture.</line>
   <line>Sacred Heart Retirement Home."</line>
   <line>Thanks, Kite.</line>
   <line>This priest, he a man-boy-love type?</line>
   <line>I hope not,
but either way, I'll find out.</line>
   <line>See ya.</line>
   <line>See ya?</line>
   <line>What do you want, a thank-you note?</line>
   <line>We ever gonna talk about
that night on the street?</line>
   <line>Talk about that night...</line>
   <line>Hmm. Maybe when this case is over.</line>
   <line>But then you'll be on another case.</line>
   <line>That's true.</line>
   <line>I tell you what.</line>
   <line>You're the workaholic.</line>
   <line>Call me at home.</line>
   <line>I don't care what time.</line>
   <line>Okay.</line>
   <line>Maybe.</line>
   <line>Tonight wouldn't be too soon.</line>
   <line>Father Declan?
- Yeah?</line>
   <line>Valens, Rush, homicide.</line>
   <line>Mind putting it on pause for a minute?</line>
   <line>What can I do for you?</line>
   <line>You remember a boy named Tim Barnes?</line>
   <line>Of course.</line>
   <line>Tragedy.</line>
   <line>He was in the boys' choir at your church.</line>
   <line>And on your baseball team...
when you were coaching.</line>
   <line>Are you accusing me of
something, Detective?</line>
   <line>You were transferred three
months after his m*rder.</line>
   <line>At my request.</line>
   <line>I'm not a pedophile.
- So, why'd you decide to leave?</line>
   <line>My white parishioners blamed the blacks.</line>
   <line>I cautioned them against
leaping to conclusions.</line>
   <line>My position was not popular.</line>
   <line>You don't think the black kids
on the corner did it?</line>
   <line>It's not for me to say.</line>
   <line>In the case file it says you went to
the Barnes house the day of the m*rder.</line>
   <line>Yes, Greg Barnes
asked me to check on Nicole.</line>
   <line>She was having a hard time coping.</line>
   <line>Needed...
cheering up.</line>
   <line>Tina!</line>
   <line>I don't know, Father,</line>
   <line>I-I have these dreams.</line>
   <line>What kind of dreams?</line>
   <line>Bad ones.</line>
   <line>You're tired.</line>
   <line>Tired doesn't cover the half of it.</line>
   <line>It's just... three's too many.</line>
   <line>Tina, don't do that again!</line>
   <line>See what I mean?</line>
   <line>Mom!
- Not a moment's peace.</line>
   <line>Tim hit me.
- Did you hit your sister?</line>
   <line>Did you hit her?</line>
   <line>Yeah, did you hit your sister?</line>
   <line>She-she made me!
- No, buts, Timothy.</line>
   <line>I've had it up to here!</line>
   <line>What do I have to do?
What do I have to do, huh?</line>
   <line>What do I have to do?
- Nicole, Nicole.</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>I'm sorry.</line>
   <line>Why didn't you ever tell
that to Detective Stillman?</line>
   <line>Nicole had suffered enough.</line>
   <line>Last thing she needed was cops
breathing down her neck.</line>
   <line>You ever see Nicole hit Timmy?</line>
   <line>She was high-strung, emotional.</line>
   <line>But did you ever see her hit the boy?</line>
   <line>Did you talk to Nicole after Tim died?</line>
   <line>Confession is a sacrament.</line>
   <line>Protected by both church and state law.</line>
   <line>How about her husband Greg?</line>
   <line>Did he come talk to you?
- I couldn't say.</line>
   <line>Couldn't or wouldn't?</line>
   <line>Someone confessed to the m*rder,
didn't they?</line>
   <line>That's why you left the parish.</line>
   <line>You couldn't stand knowing one of
your parishioners got away with it.</line>
   <line>I wouldn't say, regardless.</line>
   <line>Even if that person
k*lled an -year-old boy?</line>
   <line>Even if.</line>
   <line>Father Declan knows something.</line>
   <line>You think Tim's k*ller confessed to him?</line>
   <line>We already know he was counseling
Nicole Barnes.</line>
   <line>And it turns out she was hospitalized
twice for attempted suicides since .</line>
   <line>Her son was m*rder*d, Lil.
It'd drive any parent over the edge.</line>
   <line>According to Declan, she was over
the edge before Tim was k*lled.</line>
   <line>You must have looked at her.</line>
   <line>She said she never left
the house that night.</line>
   <line>Her husband and neighbors backed her up.</line>
   <line>I got two words for you,
boss; Andrea Yates.</line>
   <line>From what Declan says, Nicole fits
the postpartum psychosis bill to a "T".</line>
   <line>I'll give you this--in ,
that wasn't exactly on our radar.</line>
   <line>I'm gonna talk her husband.</line>
   <line>Don't go to her until you have to.</line>
   <line>District cops and BD
teams in the Badlands</line>
   <line>know of a Julius Smith, aka
Latrell Richmond, in the area.</line>
   <line>Gave us an idea
of what block he's hustling out of.</line>
   <line>You show his picture around?</line>
   <line>Door slams everywhere.</line>
   <line>Well, we gotta flush Latrell out.</line>
   <line>Time for "No dr*gs today"?</line>
   <line>Oh, I think so.</line>
   <line>What's that?</line>
   <line>You'll see.</line>
   <line>Ms. Town and Country</line>
   <line>doesn't know the pharmacy's closed.</line>
   <line>I'll give her the heads up.</line>
   <line>No dr*gs today, ma'am.</line>
   <line>You're like a Swiss watch, Greg--</line>
   <line>on your route just where
your boss said you'd be.</line>
   <line>What do you want?</line>
   <line>To talk about the night of the m*rder.</line>
   <line>I've already told you,
once is all you get.</line>
   <line>Except you left out a couple of details.
- Like?</line>
   <line>Like you asking Father Declan to look
in on Nicole the day of the m*rder.</line>
   <line>Leave Nicole out of it.</line>
   <line>Are you still in contact
with Father Declan?</line>
   <line>We stopped going to
church after Tim died.</line>
   <line>You bring Tim out on the route sometimes?</line>
   <line>How do you know that?</line>
   <line>Picture on the mantle,</line>
   <line>him wearing your postal service hat,</line>
   <line>carrying your bag.</line>
   <line>He loved to come along...</line>
   <line>carry the bag.</line>
   <line>Yeah?</line>
   <line>He was a great kid.</line>
   <line>Were Tim and his mom close?</line>
   <line>She loved him, same as I did.</line>
   <line>I don't doubt that,</line>
   <line>but sometimes people...</line>
   <line>mothers...</line>
   <line>they get so overwhelmed,
they do things they regret.</line>
   <line>Well, Nicole coped the best she could.</line>
   <line>Then why are you afraid to tell me
what happened that night?</line>
   <line>I don't know what happened.</line>
   <line>It was chaos, as usual...</line>
   <line>Tim.</line>
   <line>Timmy.</line>
   <line>Honey.</line>
   <line>Nicole.</line>
   <line>Nicole!</line>
   <line>Where the hell have you been?</line>
   <line>It's freezing out there.
- I don't feel it.</line>
   <line>I don't feel a thing.
- What are you talking about?</line>
   <line>Nothing.</line>
   <line>Where's Tim?
I can't find him.</line>
   <line>What do you mean, you can't find him?</line>
   <line>Tim!</line>
   <line>Tim?</line>
   <line>Timmy!
- I'm gonna go look outside.</line>
   <line>Greg...</line>
   <line>What?</line>
   <line>I'm sorry.
- For what?</line>
   <line>Three's too many.</line>
   <line>Stay here.</line>
   <line>Did you ask Nicole
what she was doing outside?</line>
   <line>No.</line>
   <line>And she never said.</line>
   <line>years, you don't discuss it?</line>
   <line>My wife is a good woman.</line>
   <line>She raised the two other kids just right.</line>
   <line>Now, if she did something awful to
Timmy that night, it wasn't her.</line>
   <line>Do you understand?</line>
   <line>It wasn't her.</line>
   <line>I'm going to need to talk to your wife.</line>
   <line>Not without me, you're not.</line>
   <line>This ain't your corner,
and this ain't the beach, fools.</line>
   <line>Why you acting like it is?</line>
   <line>We're just taking in the sights,
ma'am, enjoying the city.</line>
   <line>We gotta make a living same as you.</line>
   <line>That's what we're counting on.</line>
   <line>How long you gonna perpetuate
this injustice?</line>
   <line>However long as it takes
to locate who we're looking for.</line>
   <line>Maybe I can be of some assistance.</line>
   <line>Maybe then you can vamoose
the hell off of my block.</line>
   <line>We're looking for Julius Smith.</line>
   <line>Julius?</line>
   <line>He ain't worth your time.
- Know where we can find him?</line>
   <line>Can't rat out a brother,
even if he is a punk-a*s.</line>
   <line>Suit yourself.
You got any mustard?</line>
   <line>Mustard? Hell.</line>
   <line>No-good, mustard-eating mother...</line>
   <line>Now we're rolling.</line>
   <line>Yeah, she'll get Julius' name
all over the village, and quick.</line>
   <line>It's my fault, Nicole.
I never should've opened my mouth.</line>
   <line>No, it's okay, honey.</line>
   <line>You're the one who's never
wanted to talk about this.</line>
   <line>I've come to terms with what I'd done.</line>
   <line>What was that, Nicole?</line>
   <line>I went outside...</line>
   <line type="music">♪ God only knows ♪</line>
   <line type="music">♪ God makes his plan ♪</line>

   <line>I prayed with all my heart and soul.</line>
   <line>For what?</line>
   <line>For God to take away my burdens...</line>
   <line>and He did.</line>
   <line>He took away Timmy.</line>
   <line>Didn't He?</line>
   <line>Is that why you stopped
going to church, Nicole?</line>
   <line>Cause you made that paryer?</line>
   <line>It's why I tried to k*ll myself, too.</line>
   <line>Why would anyone wanna live in a world</line>
   <line>where God would answer your
paryers by k*lling your son?</line>
   <line>There she is.</line>
   <line>Hey.</line>
   <line>What are you doing here?
- You didn't call me.</line>
   <line>Um...</line>
   <line>You know how it is.</line>
   <line>Looks like I'm too
late to buy you dinner.</line>
   <line>I talked to that priest.
- Guess it'll have to be drinks.</line>
   <line>What, now?
- Yeah.</line>
   <line>You mind? / I didn't take you
for a fast-food type, Kite.</line>
   <line>You got me all wrong, Rush.</line>
   <line>Let me drop these warrants
off at Fugitives, and, uh, we'll go.</line>
   <line>You know what we need?
We need some marshmallows.</line>
   <line>Marshmallows? Hell,
we need a bigger fire.</line>
   <line>I'm freezing my nuts off.</line>
   <line>Check it out.</line>
   <line>Yo, Detectives.</line>
   <line>Yo, man?</line>
   <line>You're looking for Julius, right?
- That's right.</line>
   <line>Got a cell?
- Number's up top.</line>
   <line>I'll see what I can do.</line>
   <line>You do that.</line>
   <line>Won't be long now.</line>
   <line>Should I, uh, go into
the high school years?</line>
   <line>You like talking about
yourself, don't you?</line>
   <line>Well, someone has gotta
talk about something.</line>
   <line>I talk plenty.
- About work. Nothing good.</line>
   <line>What do you want, secrets?</line>
   <line>Yeah.</line>
   <line>Oh... you letting me in?</line>
   <line>Come on, come on,
show me where you live.</line>
   <line>You like cats?
- Sure. Yeah.</line>
   <line>Nice place.</line>
   <line>Thanks.</line>
   <line>Oh, dear God.</line>
   <line>I thought you liked cats.</line>
   <line>Cats, not... mutants.</line>
   <line>This is Olivia,</line>
   <line>Uh-huh.
- and this is...</line>
   <line>Tripod.</line>
   <line>And you were doing so well.</line>
   <line>W-What are you doing?</line>
   <line>I wanna see it down.</line>
   <line>Oh, I-I don't know about that.</line>
   <line>Another time, okay?</line>
   <line>Why not now?</line>
   <line>Because you're...</line>
   <line>because you're scaring the cats.</line>
   <line>I think you got that
reversed, but, uh, okay.</line>
   <line>It's a start... at least.</line>
   <line>To what?</line>
   <line>The adventure.</line>
   <line>See ya.</line>
   <line>Got the call an hour ago.
Julius is inside, probably asleep.</line>
   <line>I'm ready.</line>
   <line>Police!</line>
   <line>Everybody down!</line>
   <line>All right, police! Everybody down!</line>
   <line>Everybody down! Now! Down!</line>
   <line>We're upstairs!</line>
   <line>Hey, where you going?
Come over here!</line>
   <line>Come on, hands up!</line>
   <line>Julius Smith. Where is he?</line>
   <line>I don't know, man.
I don't know.</line>
   <line>What do you got here?
- What you doing, man?</line>
   <line>What's that, huh?</line>
   <line>Julius Smith.
Where is he?</line>
   <line>Come on, lady. Those are my rocks.
Come on, please.</line>
   <line>Julius Smith, where is he?</line>
   <line>In the bag, over there.</line>
   <line>Julius Smith.</line>
   <line>Latrell?</line>
   <line>Latrell?</line>
   <line>We gotta bust a cap here,
see if he moves...</line>
   <line>Show me your hands.
Let me see your hands!</line>
   <line>Time's done a real number on you,
hasn't it, Latrell?</line>
   <line>Latrell?</line>
   <line>I don't know any Latrell.</line>
   <line>Ah, man...</line>
   <line>you're still around!</line>
   <line>Where'd all your hair
disappear to, Stillman?</line>
   <line>Same place as your teeth, Latrell.</line>
   <line>Give us a minute, guys.</line>
   <line>Why'd you do it, Latrell?</line>
   <line>Why'd you k*ll Tim Barnes?</line>
   <line>I didn't k*ll nobody.</line>
   <line>I didn't believe you then,
and I don't believe you now.</line>
   <line>You ruined my life,
you know that, Stillman?</line>
   <line>The parents of that kid,</line>
   <line>the brother and sister of that kid,</line>
   <line>their lives were ruined.</line>
   <line>This case took a toll on a lot of people.</line>
   <line>- 'Cept you.
- No.</line>
   <line>Me, too, Latrell.</line>
   <line>That boy's death really
messed with your head,</line>
   <line>- didn't it, Still-man?
- That boy's name was...</line>
   <line>Tim Barnes.
Tim Barnes.</line>
   <line>You don't think I know that?</line>
   <line>You don't think that boy's
death bothered me none?</line>
   <line>Maybe there's a detail or two type
factoid I failed to mention way back when.</line>
   <line>Come here, man.</line>
   <line>Hey, you hear...?</line>
   <line>I said come here.
Come, come here.</line>
   <line>Where you think you goin',
little man, huh?</line>
   <line>Nowhere.
- Nowhere?</line>
   <line>The store. / Yeah, you're damn
right you're goin' to the store.</line>
   <line>You know why?
- Leave me alone.</line>
   <line>You gonna buy us some glue,
you hear me, Potsie?</line>
   <line>I only have a dollar.</line>
   <line>Well, that's your problem, okay?</line>
   <line>Cause you go in that cr*cker's
store and not bring us our glue,</line>
   <line>you're gonna wish your
little a*s was never born.</line>
   <line>You understand?</line>
   <line>Good.</line>
   <line>Hey, Potsie...</line>
   <line>that Elmer's glue, neither.</line>
   <line>Model glue, you hear me?</line>
   <line>Why the hell didn't you tell me that?</line>
   <line>C'mon, Still-man.</line>
   <line>Like I'm gonna tell the police</line>
   <line>I threatened to whoop a white boy's a*s
the same night that white boy gets dead?</line>
   <line>If you didn't do it,
and you haven't said</line>
   <line>anything yet that tells me
you didn't, then who did?</line>
   <line>If you got any ideas, Latrell,
now is the time.</line>
   <line>That night, when I was leaving my ma's.</line>
   <line>I seen that cr*cker, Murphy,
knockin' on the church door.</line>
   <line>One of them priests come out of the, uh...</line>
   <line>What do you call them places
where the priests live?</line>
   <line>Rectory.
- Right. Rectum-ry.</line>
   <line>Dude was wearing some funcky-a*s
Phillies pajamas.</line>
   <line>Did Murphy go back inside with him?
- No. It got me thinking.</line>
   <line>Why's Murphy in need of
spiritual-type counseling?"</line>
   <line>Think about it, Still-man.</line>
   <line>Now, that cr*cker, Murphy,
he got the-the opportunity</line>
   <line>and the motive to k*ll that boy.</line>
   <line>Well, I'll give you opportunity,
Latrell, but motive?</line>
   <line>I got it all figured out.</line>
   <line>You k*ll a white boy, right?</line>
   <line>Blame it on the black man!
What happens?</line>
   <line>Cops come in, crime go down.</line>
   <line>Crime go down, the real
estate prices go up.</line>
   <line>Now, I ask you --</line>
   <line>who stood to benefit?</line>
   <line>The man buying up all the
real estate, am I right?</line>
   <line>And who that?</line>
   <line>Sean Crackerjack Murphy, that's who.</line>
   <line>That is one hell of a theory, Latrell.</line>
   <line>It ain't a theory.</line>
   <line>That's a hypothesis, Stillman.</line>
   <line>Well, now that we got motive
all squared away...</line>
   <line>Crazy theory.
- Hypothesis.</line>
   <line>But Murphy going to the
priest is pretty interesting.</line>
   <line>Yeah, in the middle of the night,
just hours after Tim Barnes died.</line>
   <line>Someone confessed to Father Declan, Boss.</line>
   <line>But why would Murphy k*ll that kid?</line>
   <line>Ask Father Declan.</line>
   <line>Oh, Declan hasn't broken his vow
of silence in years.</line>
   <line>He ain't gonna break it now.</line>
   <line>Maybe he doesn't need to break it.</line>
   <line>Maybe we just need to make
Murphy think he's broken it.</line>
   <line>I appreciate your coming down, Father.</line>
   <line>And I apologize for giving you
a hard time the other day.</line>
   <line>Don't mention it.
- Oh, here.</line>
   <line>So... tell me your idea.</line>
   <line>Ah, what I was thinking was this...
a baseball league for cops.</line>
   <line>The problem is,
I don't know where to begin.</line>
   <line>And you, you've got experience
starting up a league, right?</line>
   <line>Oh, that was a long time ago.
- Well, I could really use some pointers.</line>
   <line>Okay, gimme that paper here.</line>
   <line>That Latrell.</line>
   <line>Ha! Must have been smokin' way too
much crack, coming up with that theory.</line>
   <line>I know</line>
   <line>pretty far-fetched, except you did get
rich off real estate, didn't you?</line>
   <line>Where is he?
I-I can't wait to I.D. his worthless a*s.</line>
   <line>Where's the lineup?
Where's Latrell?</line>
   <line>We gotta have a conversation first.</line>
   <line>All right.</line>
   <line>You were the detective
on that kid's case.</line>
   <line>And you were the kind store owner
who let Tim slide</line>
   <line>when he only had a dollar
for that notebook.</line>
   <line>That's right.</line>
   <line>Have a seat.</line>
   <line>I never guessed it would be you
sitting in here.</line>
   <line>We're exhuming Tim's body, Murph.</line>
   <line>In we didn't have DNA testing,
but it's a whole new ball game in .</line>
   <line>You don't mind, do you?</line>
   <line>I came here to identify
that boy's k*ller,</line>
   <line>Latrell Richmond.</line>
   <line>When's that gonna happen?</line>
   <line>Did you see Detective Valens
out there, Murph,</line>
   <line>taking down Father Declan's statement?</line>
   <line>He shed a lot of light on this job.</line>
   <line>Told us how you knocked on
the church door that night.</line>
   <line>How he opened it in his pajamas,</line>
   <line>let you in to confess to Tim's m*rder.</line>
   <line>Well, a priest can't talk about
what he hears in confession.</line>
   <line>That's true.</line>
   <line>Except Declan's retired.</line>
   <line>And bitter.
No allegiance to the church anymore,</line>
   <line>not after all the scandals.</line>
   <line>You... you hate little kids,
is that it, Murph?</line>
   <line>I don't hate little kids.</line>
   <line>Just black kids.</line>
   <line>Tim Barnes was white, remember?</line>
   <line>But he was a thief.</line>
   <line>He stole glue from you
for those black kids.</line>
   <line>That's an ungrateful mutt for you.</line>
   <line>He betrayed you, huh?</line>
   <line>Not just me.
Us.</line>
   <line>Guys who work an honest day
for an honest wage.</line>
   <line>White guys.</line>
   <line>Thanks, mister.</line>
   <line>Hey! Hey!</line>
   <line>You little mutt!</line>
   <line>You think you can steal from me?
- They made me.</line>
   <line>Don't lie to me, mutt.</line>
