   <line type="dialogue">You got something on a cold one?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, I just come down to take a look at
that case every once in a while.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any reason?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tender age.
The kid was eight.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your job?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No...No!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My little boy!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Calm down, please ,sir.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any good leads?
- Oh, plenty. None panned out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three black teenagers were main suspects.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We nearly had a race riot
in the neighborhood when the kid died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna take a look at it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got something new on it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. You get fresh eyes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe you'll see something I missed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Any reason you're looking back now?
Today?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What am I, one of your suspects?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, you're avoiding my questions like one?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I can take a hint.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Be mysterious.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tim Barnes was hit once in the face
below the right eye,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">presumably knocked unconscious.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He died of hypothermia.
- No prints, no witnesses.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The lead suspect
was a -year-old glue-sniffer</line>
   <line type="dialogue">named Latrell Richmond.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Juvenile record of as*ault and burglary.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He and his pals hung out
at a corner by the store</line>
   <line type="dialogue">where Tim Barnes bought that notebook.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You interview him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So after the boy goes into the store?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I saw him leave.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Headed north on Grover.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did you do after you saw the boy
walking north on Grover?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing. Chilled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't follow him,
maybe try and rob him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You deaf, Still-man?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I gotta repeat everything?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anyone see you chillin'
on the corner, Latrell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Other than your two friends?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, it was... it was cold out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nobody was out.
- What about Mr. Murphy, the store clerk?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He see you chillin'?
- How do I know?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I stayed away from that white boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">just like the Philly PD.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We released him into
his mother's custody.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were gonna box him in the morning,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about his two friends?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were polygraphed.
Both passed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One is dead now, and the other's
serving time, won't talk to cops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Latrell's mom around?
- Yeah, she and his two sisters always</line>
   <line type="dialogue">claimed they had no
idea where he went.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Let's fan out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll go to the parents.
You go to the store clerk.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The clerk was the
last to see Tim alive?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yep.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe Jeffries and Vera
can pay Latrell's family a visit.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tim loved delivering the mail
with his dad in the summer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your other two?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, that's Tina in California.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's a vet now, lives in Modesto.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And that's Brian, he's my youngest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's a law student of Syracus.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, Greg, honey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Uh, this is Detective Rush.
She's here about Tim.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What about him? / I'd like to talk to you
about the night he was k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Lieutenant Stillman sent me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's lieutenant now, huh?
- Mm-hmm.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was a nice man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I told her it was okay.
I can handle it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wanna know what happened
that night, I'll tell you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Once.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, mom, can I go to the store
to buy a notebook for math?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ask your father.
- I got a dollar. I'll pay for it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I said ask your father.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dad, that hurt.
- Hey, dad,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">can I go to the store to buy a notebook
for math class? / Stop it! Stop it!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tina, your hair's gotta be washed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dad. / No, it doesn't.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dad.
- What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can I go to the store
to buy a notebook?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ask your mother.
- But she said to ask you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are we done, Daddy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stop squirming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Forget you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tina, stop squirming.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You have kids...
Detective?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Because you don't know
the meaning of exhausion</line>
   <line type="dialogue">until you've had a colicky newborn
on top of two others.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We were outgunned,
weren't we, honey?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three against two.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How much time passed
before you noticed Tim was missing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Um... two...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">two and a half hours.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's how nuts we were.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then what'd you do?
- We called Tim's friends.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Um, checked around the block,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and pretty soon we got scared,
so we called the cops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">By the time they found him...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tim was frozen to death.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If we would have just
noticed him missing earlier...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's okay, sweetie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like I said, once is all
I'm gonna tell that story.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, hey! Hey!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Watch that.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wilma Richmond?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Detectives Vera, Jeffries.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My daughters told me you called them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ain't gonna get nothing outta me
you didn't get outta my girls.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Think maybe we can
come in, Ms. Wilma?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, we are, uh, sitting ducks out here.
- And it's cold.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't bother the kids none.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Besides, you got blubber on you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll only be a minute.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So your daughters say
they haven't seen Latrell</line>
   <line type="dialogue">since the night he disappeard in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ditto.
- No phone calls, letters?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What did I just say?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Besides, if I knew
where Latrell was,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">which I don't,
you think I'd tell you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't hear me wrong?
I feel bad for that family,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but they're not the only ones
lost a boy that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I lost my son the same
as they lost theirs.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So what happened that night,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">after you brought Latrell home
from Homicide?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't like to think
about that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can understand that.
- Oh, yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You lost a boy, Detective?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, ma'am. / Then why are you
talking about understanding?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Trell was my eldest,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the man of the house,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but he was still just a boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We'll get us a lawyer, Trell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ain't gotta run.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We can't afford no lawyer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where are you gonna go?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't know, but if I stay here,
the police'll beat my a*s till I confess,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know they will.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got any money?
- No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not cleaning you out, Mom.
- Take it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">years old.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can you imagine how scared he was?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your grandkids?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From my daughters.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thank God I at least have them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now if you don't mind,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">why don't you go harass some
other innocent black people?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sean Murphy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Call me Murph-- everyone does.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're a long way from clerking
at the five-and-dime, Murph.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's what a little hard work can do.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">this is about Tim Barnes?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I understand you were the last
person to see him alive.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Aside from whoever k*lled him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He bought some from your store?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A black-and-white composition book.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Was Tim a kid you knew from
the neighborhood?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He came into the store occasionally,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">never had enough money.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'd let him slide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Felt sorry for him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why is that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There were these black
kids in the area.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I think they were picking on him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They do that a lot?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They were always hanging
around the corner, harassing people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mutts had the lazy gene,
if you know what I mean.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You see Tim with them mutts that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You bet I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They ever bother you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, they knew better.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know this guy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, he was the ringleader of those kids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Laquanda or something.
- Latrell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You didn't actually see him or any of
his pals hurt the boy though, did you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If I would have seen something,
I would have intervened.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I would have kick those...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">African-American young
gentlemen's asses.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Barnes speak highly of you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How are they doing?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Getting by, I guess.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That kind of wound doesn't heal.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I used to call them a lot.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I stopped when I didn't have
anything new to tell them.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You buying baby furniture?
- No, it's my daughter.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She's pregnant.
- How far along?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A couple of months.
I just found out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Anything from Latrell's family?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mother and sisters are
sticking to their stories.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think he could be dead?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I doubt it. Latrell
was a survivor of sorts.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So is that the new direction?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hearing your daughter's pregnant?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It got me thinking
about this case, yeah,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and feeling guilty.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">About what? / I was working the
Barnes job when my daughter was born.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I missed her birth completely.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My wife, uh, wasn't pleased.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I lost my marriage over a case
I couldn't even solve.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, no wonder you
don't want back on it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The sad part is, I do, though.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I want this thing solved.
I want it put to rest.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I get it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, you don't,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but you will one day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hopefully before I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Murphy's a piece of work;
into genetics racial superiority.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He thinks Latrell's the doer?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">ID'ed him off his picture
in a second flat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We got something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Latrell's two sisters, Lisa and Leslie.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">They got three kids apiece.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But according to Wilma Richmond,
she has seven grandkids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, so who's lucky number seven?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thinking maybe he's Latrell's?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're gonna find out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're on the street, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Us, too.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Going to the crime scene.
- Good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ain't too often we got the Assigned
available to go with us. / Uh-huh</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Be a big help.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll get my coat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Used to be a working
class neighborhood...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">half black, half white.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A lot of racial tension.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This is where Tim died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Except he was lying in snow, not slush.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That coffee shop there
was a five-and-dime</line>
   <line type="dialogue">where Tim Barnes bought his notebook.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where Murphy worked.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In this corner right here,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">this is where Latrell and
his pals were sniffing glue.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even the church is getting a facelift.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The Barnes were Catholics, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, Tim was in the boys' choir.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You talk to the priest?
- Yeah. Father Declan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was in the church that night,
but he didn't see or hear anything.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">There wasn't a pedophilia scandal
back in , was there?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No. Just pedophilia.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, what, the guy's a priest,
so automatically he's a pedophile?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, but don't we gotta look at it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, he was close to the family,
both the parents and the kids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Diocese won't disclose the priest's
whereabouts without a court order.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You got a relationship
with ADA Kite, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you mean, a relationship?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I mean, maybe you can give him a call.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He could help us, uh,
cut through the red tape.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, I... could call him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did a search of Latrell's
mother's phone records.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Other than her daughters,
one other name comes up consistently.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's Candace Smith.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Who's that? / -year-old nurse
with a -year-old boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wilma Richmond had a picture
of her kid in her apartment.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Looks to be about .
- The seventh grandkid?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Latrell's, maybe.
With Candace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Wilma told you to talk to me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're here about her son, Latrell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Latrell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that's a name I
haven't heard in a long time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Um...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">this is a picture of him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That there was Latrell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">A couple of names back, that is.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When I married him, he was
going by Julius Smith.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your boy sure looks like him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't remind me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You wouldn't happen to know
where Julius is, would you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Michael,
wanna give us some privacy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like I never heard you
badmouthing Julius before.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Go.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julius Smith is a low-rent,
two-timing,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">piss-poor excuse of a man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Kicked his worthless butt
out the door six years ago.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He doesn't call,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Child support?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The day he left,
he cleaned me and Michael out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Took his own son's GameBoy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He an addict?
- Addict, dealer.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Last I heard, he was hustling
out of the Badlands.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But what did he do now?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know what? Don't tell me.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't want to know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You find Julius Latrell--</line>
   <line type="dialogue">whatever the hell his name is,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">tell him his son's a straight-A student.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He's grown up to be a real man,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not like his lying a*s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, ma'am, we most definitely will.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went to law school with Sherman Markey,
one of the diocese's attorneys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He spared us the rigmarole.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Your Father Declan's in a retirement home
for priests put out to pasture.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sacred Heart Retirement Home."</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks, Kite.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This priest, he a man-boy-love type?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I hope not,
but either way, I'll find out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">See ya.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">See ya?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you want, a thank-you note?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We ever gonna talk about
that night on the street?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Talk about that night...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hmm. Maybe when this case is over.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But then you'll be on another case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's true.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I tell you what.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're the workaholic.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Call me at home.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't care what time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tonight wouldn't be too soon.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Father Declan?
- Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Valens, Rush, homicide.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mind putting it on pause for a minute?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What can I do for you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You remember a boy named Tim Barnes?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Of course.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tragedy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was in the boys' choir at your church.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And on your baseball team...
when you were coaching.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you accusing me of
something, Detective?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were transferred three
months after his m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">At my request.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm not a pedophile.
- So, why'd you decide to leave?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My white parishioners blamed the blacks.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I cautioned them against
leaping to conclusions.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My position was not popular.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't think the black kids
on the corner did it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's not for me to say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In the case file it says you went to
the Barnes house the day of the m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yes, Greg Barnes
asked me to check on Nicole.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was having a hard time coping.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Needed...
cheering up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tina!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know, Father,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I-I have these dreams.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What kind of dreams?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Bad ones.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're tired.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tired doesn't cover the half of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's just... three's too many.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tina, don't do that again!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">See what I mean?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mom!
- Not a moment's peace.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tim hit me.
- Did you hit your sister?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you hit her?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, did you hit your sister?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She-she made me!
- No, buts, Timothy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've had it up to here!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do I have to do?
What do I have to do, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do I have to do?
- Nicole, Nicole.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why didn't you ever tell
that to Detective Stillman?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nicole had suffered enough.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Last thing she needed was cops
breathing down her neck.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ever see Nicole hit Timmy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She was high-strung, emotional.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But did you ever see her hit the boy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you talk to Nicole after Tim died?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Confession is a sacrament.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Protected by both church and state law.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How about her husband Greg?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did he come talk to you?
- I couldn't say.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Couldn't or wouldn't?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone confessed to the m*rder,
didn't they?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's why you left the parish.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You couldn't stand knowing one of
your parishioners got away with it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I wouldn't say, regardless.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even if that person
k*lled an -year-old boy?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Even if.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Father Declan knows something.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You think Tim's k*ller confessed to him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We already know he was counseling
Nicole Barnes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And it turns out she was hospitalized
twice for attempted suicides since .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her son was m*rder*d, Lil.
It'd drive any parent over the edge.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">According to Declan, she was over
the edge before Tim was k*lled.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You must have looked at her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She said she never left
the house that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Her husband and neighbors backed her up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got two words for you,
boss; Andrea Yates.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">From what Declan says, Nicole fits
the postpartum psychosis bill to a "T".</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll give you this--in ,
that wasn't exactly on our radar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm gonna talk her husband.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't go to her until you have to.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">District cops and BD
teams in the Badlands</line>
   <line type="dialogue">know of a Julius Smith, aka
Latrell Richmond, in the area.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Gave us an idea
of what block he's hustling out of.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You show his picture around?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Door slams everywhere.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, we gotta flush Latrell out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Time for "No dr*gs today"?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, I think so.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You'll see.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ms. Town and Country</line>
   <line type="dialogue">doesn't know the pharmacy's closed.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'll give her the heads up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No dr*gs today, ma'am.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're like a Swiss watch, Greg--</line>
   <line type="dialogue">on your route just where
your boss said you'd be.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you want?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">To talk about the night of the m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've already told you,
once is all you get.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Except you left out a couple of details.
- Like?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like you asking Father Declan to look
in on Nicole the day of the m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Leave Nicole out of it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Are you still in contact
with Father Declan?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We stopped going to
church after Tim died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You bring Tim out on the route sometimes?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How do you know that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Picture on the mantle,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">him wearing your postal service hat,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">carrying your bag.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He loved to come along...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">carry the bag.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He was a great kid.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Were Tim and his mom close?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She loved him, same as I did.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't doubt that,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">but sometimes people...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">mothers...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">they get so overwhelmed,
they do things they regret.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, Nicole coped the best she could.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Then why are you afraid to tell me
what happened that night?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know what happened.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It was chaos, as usual...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tim.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Timmy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Honey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nicole.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nicole!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where the hell have you been?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's freezing out there.
- I don't feel it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't feel a thing.
- What are you talking about?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nothing.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where's Tim?
I can't find him.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you mean, you can't find him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tim!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tim?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Timmy!
- I'm gonna go look outside.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Greg...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm sorry.
- For what?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Three's too many.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Stay here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you ask Nicole
what she was doing outside?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And she never said.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">years, you don't discuss it?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">My wife is a good woman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">She raised the two other kids just right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, if she did something awful to
Timmy that night, it wasn't her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Do you understand?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It wasn't her.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm going to need to talk to your wife.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not without me, you're not.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This ain't your corner,
and this ain't the beach, fools.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why you acting like it is?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're just taking in the sights,
ma'am, enjoying the city.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta make a living same as you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's what we're counting on.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How long you gonna perpetuate
this injustice?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">However long as it takes
to locate who we're looking for.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe I can be of some assistance.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe then you can vamoose
the hell off of my block.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're looking for Julius Smith.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julius?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He ain't worth your time.
- Know where we can find him?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Can't rat out a brother,
even if he is a punk-a*s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Suit yourself.
You got any mustard?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Mustard? Hell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No-good, mustard-eating mother...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now we're rolling.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, she'll get Julius' name
all over the village, and quick.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It's my fault, Nicole.
I never should've opened my mouth.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">No, it's okay, honey.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You're the one who's never
wanted to talk about this.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I've come to terms with what I'd done.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What was that, Nicole?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I went outside...</line>

   <line type="dialogue">I talk plenty.

   <line type="dialogue">Got the call an hour ago.
Julius is inside, probably asleep.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I'm ready.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Police!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everybody down!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right, police! Everybody down!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Everybody down! Now! Down!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're upstairs!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, where you going?
Come over here!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, hands up!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julius Smith. Where is he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know, man.
I don't know.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you got here?
- What you doing, man?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What's that, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julius Smith.
Where is he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come on, lady. Those are my rocks.
Come on, please.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julius Smith, where is he?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In the bag, over there.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Julius Smith.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Latrell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Latrell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta bust a cap here,
see if he moves...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Show me your hands.
Let me see your hands!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Time's done a real number on you,
hasn't it, Latrell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Latrell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't know any Latrell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ah, man...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you're still around!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where'd all your hair
disappear to, Stillman?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Same place as your teeth, Latrell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Give us a minute, guys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why'd you do it, Latrell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why'd you k*ll Tim Barnes?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't k*ll nobody.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I didn't believe you then,
and I don't believe you now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You ruined my life,
you know that, Stillman?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The parents of that kid,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">the brother and sister of that kid,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">their lives were ruined.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">This case took a toll on a lot of people.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">- 'Cept you.
- No.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Me, too, Latrell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That boy's death really
messed with your head,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">- didn't it, Still-man?
- That boy's name was...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tim Barnes.
Tim Barnes.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't think I know that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't think that boy's
death bothered me none?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe there's a detail or two type
factoid I failed to mention way back when.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Come here, man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, you hear...?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I said come here.
Come, come here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where you think you goin',
little man, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Nowhere.
- Nowhere?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The store. / Yeah, you're damn
right you're goin' to the store.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You know why?
- Leave me alone.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You gonna buy us some glue,
you hear me, Potsie?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I only have a dollar.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, that's your problem, okay?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cause you go in that cr*cker's
store and not bring us our glue,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">you're gonna wish your
little a*s was never born.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You understand?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Good.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey, Potsie...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">that Elmer's glue, neither.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Model glue, you hear me?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why the hell didn't you tell me that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">C'mon, Still-man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Like I'm gonna tell the police</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I threatened to whoop a white boy's a*s
the same night that white boy gets dead?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If you didn't do it,
and you haven't said</line>
   <line type="dialogue">anything yet that tells me
you didn't, then who did?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">If you got any ideas, Latrell,
now is the time.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That night, when I was leaving my ma's.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I seen that cr*cker, Murphy,
knockin' on the church door.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">One of them priests come out of the, uh...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">What do you call them places
where the priests live?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Rectory.
- Right. Rectum-ry.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Dude was wearing some funcky-a*s
Phillies pajamas.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did Murphy go back inside with him?
- No. It got me thinking.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Why's Murphy in need of
spiritual-type counseling?"</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Think about it, Still-man.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, that cr*cker, Murphy,
he got the-the opportunity</line>
   <line type="dialogue">and the motive to k*ll that boy.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, I'll give you opportunity,
Latrell, but motive?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I got it all figured out.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You k*ll a white boy, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Blame it on the black man!
What happens?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Cops come in, crime go down.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Crime go down, the real
estate prices go up.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Now, I ask you --</line>
   <line type="dialogue">who stood to benefit?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The man buying up all the
real estate, am I right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And who that?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Sean Crackerjack Murphy, that's who.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That is one hell of a theory, Latrell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">It ain't a theory.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's a hypothesis, Stillman.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, now that we got motive
all squared away...</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Crazy theory.
- Hypothesis.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But Murphy going to the
priest is pretty interesting.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Yeah, in the middle of the night,
just hours after Tim Barnes died.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Someone confessed to Father Declan, Boss.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But why would Murphy k*ll that kid?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ask Father Declan.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, Declan hasn't broken his vow
of silence in years.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He ain't gonna break it now.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe he doesn't need to break it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Maybe we just need to make
Murphy think he's broken it.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I appreciate your coming down, Father.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And I apologize for giving you
a hard time the other day.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Don't mention it.
- Oh, here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">So... tell me your idea.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ah, what I was thinking was this...
a baseball league for cops.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">The problem is,
I don't know where to begin.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you, you've got experience
starting up a league, right?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Oh, that was a long time ago.
- Well, I could really use some pointers.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Okay, gimme that paper here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That Latrell.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Ha! Must have been smokin' way too
much crack, coming up with that theory.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I know</line>
   <line type="dialogue">pretty far-fetched, except you did get
rich off real estate, didn't you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where is he?
I-I can't wait to I.D. his worthless a*s.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Where's the lineup?
Where's Latrell?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We gotta have a conversation first.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">All right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You were the detective
on that kid's case.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And you were the kind store owner
who let Tim slide</line>
   <line type="dialogue">when he only had a dollar
for that notebook.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's right.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Have a seat.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I never guessed it would be you
sitting in here.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">We're exhuming Tim's body, Murph.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">In we didn't have DNA testing,
but it's a whole new ball game in .</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You don't mind, do you?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I came here to identify
that boy's k*ller,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Latrell Richmond.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">When's that gonna happen?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Did you see Detective Valens
out there, Murph,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">taking down Father Declan's statement?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He shed a lot of light on this job.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Told us how you knocked on
the church door that night.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">How he opened it in his pajamas,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">let you in to confess to Tim's m*rder.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Well, a priest can't talk about
what he hears in confession.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's true.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Except Declan's retired.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">And bitter.
No allegiance to the church anymore,</line>
   <line type="dialogue">not after all the scandals.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You... you hate little kids,
is that it, Murph?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">I don't hate little kids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Just black kids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Tim Barnes was white, remember?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">But he was a thief.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He stole glue from you
for those black kids.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">That's an ungrateful mutt for you.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">He betrayed you, huh?</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Not just me.
Us.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Guys who work an honest day
for an honest wage.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">White guys.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Thanks, mister.</line>
   <line type="dialogue">Hey! Hey!</line>
   <line type="dialogue">You little mutt!</line>
