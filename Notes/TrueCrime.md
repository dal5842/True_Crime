### True Crime Show Transcripts
Doing the transcript of either the Bundy/Gacy/Dahmer confession tapes or the cold case files shown on Netflix. I would like to compare the similarities and differences in these transcripts. Alternatively finding a serial killer or unsolved mystery and watching episodes on that “entity” across different shows or movies.
