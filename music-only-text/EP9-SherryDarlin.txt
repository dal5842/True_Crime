♪ Don HenleyÀÇ "The End of the Innocence" ♪♪ Remember when the days were long ♪♪ And rolled beneath a deep blue sky ♪♪ Didn't have a care in the world ♪♪ With mommy and daddy standing by ♪♪ When "happily ever after" fails ♪♪ And we've been poisoned
by these fairy tales ♪♪ The lawyers dwell on small details ♪♪ Since daddy had to fly ♪♪ But I know a place where we can go ♪♪ That's still untouched by man ♪♪ We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by ♪♪ And the tall grass wave in the wind ♪♪ You can lay your head back on the ground ♪♪ And let your hair fall all around me ♪♪ Offer up your best defense ♪♪ But this is the end ♪♪ This is the end of the innocence ♪♪ O' beautiful, for spacious skies ♪♪ But now those skies are threatening ♪♪ They're beating plowshares into swords ♪♪ For this tired old man that
we elected king ♪♪ Armchair warriors often fail ♪♪ And we've been poisoned
by these fairy tales ♪♪ The lawyers clean up all details ♪♪ Since daddy had to lie ♪♪ But I know a place where we can go ♪♪ And wash away this sin ♪♪ We'll sit and watch the clouds roll by ♪♪ And the tall grass wave in the wind ♪♪ Just lay your head back
on the ground ♪♪ And let your hair spill all around me ♪♪ Offer up your best defense ♪♪ But this is the end ♪♪ This is the end of the innocence ♪
