♪ JewelÀÇ 'Hands' ♪♪ If I could tell the world just one thing it would be ♪♪ that we're all okay ♪♪ And not to worry
'cause worry is wasteful ♪♪ And unless in times like these ♪♪ I won't be made useless ♪♪ I won't be idled with dispair ♪♪ I will gather myself around my faith ♪♪ for light does the darkness most fear ♪♪ My hands are small, I know, ♪♪ but they're not yours they are my own ♪♪ but they're not yours they are my own ♪♪ and I am never broken ♪♪ Poverty stole your golden shoes ♪♪ but it didn't steel your laughter ♪♪ And heartache came to visit me ♪♪ but I knew it wasnt ever after ♪♪ We'll fight, not out of spite ♪♪ for someone must
stand up for what's right ♪♪ cause where there's
a man who has no voice ♪♪ there our's shall go singing ♪♪ My hands are small, I know, ♪♪ but they're not yours
they are my own ♪♪ but they're not yours
they are my own ♪♪ and I am never broken ♪♪ In the end♪ only kindness matters ♪♪ In the end♪ only kindness matters ♪
