♪ Well I guess it would be nice ♪♪ If I could touch your body ♪♪ I know not everybody ♪♪ Has got a body like you ♪♪ But I've got to think twice ♪♪ Before I give my heart away ♪♪ And I know all the games you play ♪♪ Because I play them too ♪♪ Oh but I need some time
off from that emotion ♪♪ Time to pick my heart up off the floor ♪♪ And when that love comes down ♪♪ Without devotion ♪♪ Well it takes a strong man baby ♪♪ MadonnaÀÇ "Live To Tell" ♪♪ I have a tale to tell ♪♪ Sometimes it gets
so hard to hide it well ♪♪ I was not ready for the fall ♪♪ Too blind to see
the writing on the wall ♪♪ A man can tell a thousand lies ♪♪ I've learned my lesson well ♪♪ Hope I live to tell ♪♪ The secret I have
learned, 'till then ♪♪ It will burn inside of me ♪♪ The truth is never far behind ♪♪ You kept it hidden well ♪♪ If I live to tell ♪♪ The secret I knew then ♪♪ Will I ever have the chance again ♪
