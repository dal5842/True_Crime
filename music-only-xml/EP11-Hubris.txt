♪ OasisÀÇ "Don't look back in anger" ♪♪ Slip inside the eye of your mind ♪♪ Don't you know you might find ♪♪ A better place to play ♪♪ You said that you'd never been ♪♪ But all the things
that you've seen ♪♪ Will slowly fade away ♪♪ So I start a revolution
from my bed ♪♪ Cos you said the brains
I have went to my head ♪♪ Step outside the
summertime's in bloom ♪♪ Stand up beside the fireplace ♪♪ Take that look from off your face♪♪ You ain't ever gonna
burn my heart out♪♪ My soul slides away, ♪♪ but don't look back in anger ♪♪ I heard you say ♪♪ My soul slides away, ♪♪ but don't look back in anger ♪♪ Don't look back in anger ♪♪ I heard you say...♪
