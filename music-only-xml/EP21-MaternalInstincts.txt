♪ I'm trying to tell you
something bout my life ♪♪ Maybe give me insight
between black and white ♪♪ And the best thing
you've ever done for me ♪♪ Is to help me take
my life less seriously ♪♪ It's only life after all ♪♪ Now darkness has
a hunger that's insatiable ♪♪ And lightness has
a call that's hard to hear ♪♪ I wrap my fear around
me like a blanket ♪♪ I sailed my ship of
safety till I sank it ♪♪ I'm crawling on your shores ♪♪ Close your eyes,
give me your hand, darling ♪♪ Do you feel my heart beating ♪♪ Do you understand ♪♪ Do you feel the same ♪♪ Am I only dreaming ♪♪ Is this burning an eternal flame ♪♪ I believe it's meant to be, darling ♪♪ I watch you when you are sleeping ♪♪ You belong with me ♪♪ Do you feel the same ♪♪ Am I only dreaming ♪♪ Or is this burning an eternal flame ♪♪ Say my name,
sun shines through the rain ♪♪ A whole life so lonely ♪♪ And then you come and ease the pain ♪♪ I don't want to lose this feeling ♪♪ Oh ♪♪ Say my name,
sun shines through the rain ♪♪ A whole life so lonely ♪♪ And then you come and ease the pain ♪♪ I don't want to lose this feeling ♪♪ Oh, oh, eternal flame ♪♪ Close your eyes,
give me your hand, darling ♪♪ Do you feel my heart beating ♪♪ Do you understand ♪
